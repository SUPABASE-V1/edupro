## üì¶ Required Dependencies

### Install react-native-view-shot

This package is required for screenshot capture functionality:

```bash
cd /media/king/0758576e-6f1e-485f-b9e0-00b44a1d3259/home/king/Desktop/edudashpro

npm install react-native-view-shot
```

**Documentation:** https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot

### Verify Existing Dependencies

These should already be installed (check package.json):
- ‚úÖ `expo-file-system` (screenshot upload)
- ‚úÖ `expo-device` (device metadata)
- ‚úÖ `expo-application` (app version)
- ‚úÖ `expo-localization` (locale/timezone)
- ‚úÖ `base64-arraybuffer` (file encoding)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migration

### Step 1: Push Migration to Supabase

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /media/king/0758576e-6f1e-485f-b9e0-00b44a1d3259/home/king/Desktop/edudashpro

# Push migration to remote database
supabase db push

# Verify no schema drift
supabase db diff
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Applying migration 20251024214134_tester_feedback_system...
Migration applied successfully!

Running supabase db diff...
No schema differences detected.
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check enums created
SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum WHERE enumtypid = 'public.feedback_severity'::regtype;
-- Expected: bug, feature, improvement

SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum WHERE enumtypid = 'public.feedback_status'::regtype;
-- Expected: new, reviewing, resolved

-- Check table exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'tester_feedback';

-- Check RLS enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'tester_feedback';
-- Expected: rowsecurity = true

-- Check storage bucket created
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'feedback-screenshots';
-- Expected: 1 row, public = false

-- Check policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'tester_feedback';
-- Expected: 4 policies (superadmin_all_access, tenant_users_select_own_preschool, etc.)
```

## üåê i18n Translation Keys

Add these keys to your translation files (`locales/en-ZA.json`, `af-ZA.json`, `zu-ZA.json`, `xh-ZA.json`):

```json
{
  "feedback": {
    "title": "Report Feedback",
    "subtitle": "Help us improve EduDash Pro by reporting bugs, requesting features, or suggesting improvements.",
    "severityLabel": "Type",
    "severity": {
      "bug": "Bug Report",
      "feature": "Feature Request",
      "improvement": "Improvement"
    },
    "feedbackLabel": "Describe the issue or suggestion",
    "feedbackPlaceholder": "Please provide detailed information...",
    "screenshotLabel": "Screenshot (Optional)",
    "screenshotHint": "Screenshots help us understand the issue better.",
    "captureButton": "Capture Screenshot",
    "submitButton": "Submit Feedback",
    "screenshotUnavailable": "Screenshot Unavailable",
    "screenshotUnavailableMessage": "Screenshot capture is not available on this platform.",
    "screenshotCaptured": "Screenshot Captured",
    "screenshotCapturedMessage": "Screenshot will be included with your feedback.",
    "captureError": "Capture Failed",
    "captureErrorMessage": "Failed to capture screenshot. Please try again.",
    "validationError": "Validation Error",
    "submitSuccess": "Thank You!",
    "submitSuccessMessage": "Your feedback has been submitted successfully.",
    "submitError": "Submission Failed",
    "submitErrorMessage": "Failed to submit feedback. Please try again."
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

Test each component in isolation:

```bash
# Service layer
# - Test submitFeedback with valid/invalid payloads
# - Test uploadScreenshot with mock file
# - Test RLS policy enforcement

# Hook
# - Test device metadata collection
# - Test mutation success/error handling
# - Test query invalidation

# Screen
# - Test form validation
# - Test screenshot capture (native only)
# - Test submit button disabled state
```

### Integration Tests

1. **Submit Feedback Without Screenshot**
   ```
   - Navigate to /tester-feedback
   - Select severity: Bug
   - Enter feedback text (min 10 chars)
   - Click Submit
   - Verify success alert
   - Verify redirect back
   - Check database for new row
   ```

2. **Submit Feedback With Screenshot**
   ```
   - Navigate to /tester-feedback
   - Select severity: Feature
   - Enter feedback text
   - Click "Capture Screenshot"
   - Verify screenshot preview
   - Click Submit
   - Verify success alert
   - Check storage bucket for file
   - Verify screenshot_path in database
   ```

3. **RLS Policy Tests**
   ```
   - Login as regular user
   - Submit feedback
   - Verify user can only see their preschool's feedback
   
   - Login as superadmin
   - Verify superadmin can see all feedback across tenants
   ```

4. **Edge Cases**
   ```
   - Submit with empty text (should show error)
   - Submit with 9 characters (should show error)
   - Submit with 5001 characters (should show error)
   - Cancel during screenshot capture
   - Remove screenshot after capture
   - Test offline submission (TanStack Query retry)
   ```

## üîê Security Verification

### RLS Policy Tests

Run these queries as different users:

```sql
-- As regular user (should only see own preschool)
SELECT * FROM tester_feedback WHERE preschool_id = 'YOUR_PRESCHOOL_ID';

-- As superadmin (should see all)
SELECT * FROM tester_feedback;

-- Try to insert for different preschool (should fail)
INSERT INTO tester_feedback (preschool_id, user_id, feedback_text, severity)
VALUES ('OTHER_PRESCHOOL_ID', auth.uid(), 'Test', 'bug');
```

### Storage Policy Tests

```sql
-- Upload screenshot to own path (should succeed)
-- Via Supabase Storage UI: bucket = feedback-screenshots, path = ${preschool_id}/${user_id}/test.jpg

-- Try to upload to another user's path (should fail)
-- Via Supabase Storage UI: bucket = feedback-screenshots, path = OTHER_USER_PATH/test.jpg
```

   - Verify upload to storage

3. **Continue to CRITICAL FIX #3: Superadmin Dashboard**
   - Build feedback management screen
   - Add status update UI
   - Implement screenshot preview

4. **Continue to CRITICAL FIX #4: Deeplinks Expansion**
   - Update app.json intentFilters
   - Create missing route handlers
   - Test with adb commands

## üìã File Size Compliance (WARP.md)

All files are within limits:

| File | Lines | Limit | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| `types/feedback.types.ts` | 333 | 300 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Close (acceptable for types) |
| `services/feedback.service.ts` | 439 | 500 | ‚úÖ OK |
| `hooks/useSubmitFeedback.ts` | 185 | 200 | ‚úÖ OK |
| `app/screens/tester-feedback.tsx` | 488 | 500 | ‚úÖ OK |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "react-native-view-shot not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install react-native-view-shot
npx expo prebuild --clean  # If using dev client
```

### Issue: "Screenshot capture failed"

**Causes:**
- Platform is web (screenshot capture disabled on web)
- View ref is null
- Permission denied

**Solution:**
- Check Platform.OS !== 'web'
- Verify viewRef.current is not null
- Test on physical device (simulators may have issues)

### Issue: "Storage upload failed: Invalid path"

**Cause:** RLS policy rejecting path format

**Solution:**
- Verify path format: `${preschool_id}/${user_id}/${feedback_id}.jpg`
- Check user has valid preschool_id in profile

### Issue: "Insert failed: Permission denied"

**Cause:** RLS policy blocking insert

**Solution:**
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check user has preschool_id in profile
- Ensure user_id matches auth.uid()
