# ðŸš€ DASH AI COMPREHENSIVE ENHANCEMENT PLAN

## Phase 1: Enable Porcupine Wake Word (Preview Build)

### Why Preview Build?
âœ… Preview builds compile native code (including Porcupine)  
âœ… Faster than production build  
âœ… Can be shared via WhatsApp for testing  

### Build Command
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**Expected**: After installing the preview build, wake word "Hello Dash" will work!

## Phase 5: Dash Personality Enhancement

### Enhanced Context Awareness

```typescript
interface DashContext {
  currentScreen: string;
  userRole: 'teacher' | 'principal' | 'parent' | 'student';
  recentActivity: {
    screens: string[];
    actions: string[];
    timestamps: number[];
  };
  currentFocus: {
    students?: string[];
    classes?: string[];
    subjects?: string[];
    assignments?: string[];
  };
  pendingTasks: Array<{
    type: string;
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
    deadline?: Date;
    description: string;
  }>;
  appState: {
    hasUnreadMessages: boolean;
    pendingGrading: number;
    upcomingDeadlines: number;
    lowPerformingStudents: number;
  };
}
```

### Enhanced Response Generation

Dash will now:
1. **Understand screen context**: Different responses based on where user is
2. **Suggest relevant actions**: Based on current screen and role
3. **Track conversation flow**: Remember what was discussed
4. **Proactive notifications**: Alert about important events
5. **Multi-step assistance**: Guide through complex workflows

User: "Help me with lessons"
Dash: "I can help you create lesson plans. What subject?"
```

### After
```
User: "Help me with lessons"

      3. Generate a lesson based on your curriculum
      4. Create a full lesson + worksheet package
      What would you like to do?"

      ðŸ“š Opening Lesson Generator...
      [Navigates to lesson generator with pre-filled data]
      I've prefilled some details based on your recent teaching.
      What subject should we focus on?"
```
