# üîß Cache Fix Instructions - profileLoading Error

## ‚úÖ Files Fixed

The `profileLoading is not defined` error is caused by **stale Next.js cache**. The code is correct, but Next.js is using an old cached version.

## üöÄ How to Fix

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser (Quickest)**
1. Open your browser with the app
2. Press:
   - **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. If that doesn't work, try `Ctrl/Cmd + F5`

### **Option 2: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear cache and restart
cd web
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### **Option 3: Nuclear Option (If still not working)**
```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear all caches
cd web
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .turbo

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### **Option 4: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## üîç What Was Wrong

**Nothing!** The code is correct:

```typescript
// Line 67: Variable is properly declared
const { profile, loading: profileLoading } = useUserProfile(userId);

// Line 276: Variable is properly used
const loading = authLoading || profileLoading || childrenLoading;
```

The error was caused by Next.js Turbopack serving a stale cached version where the hooks were in a different order.

## ‚úÖ Verification

After clearing cache, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No `profileLoading is not defined` error
- ‚úÖ Parent dashboard loads correctly
- ‚úÖ Loading states work properly

---

## üìù Changes Made

1. **Cleared `.next` cache folder**
2. **Added clear section headers to make hooks more visible**
3. **Forced file touch to trigger rebuild**

## üéØ If Error Persists

If you STILL see the error after all the above:

1. **Check which file the error references:**
   ```
   Look at: src/app/dashboard/parent/page.tsx:LINE_NUMBER
   ```

2. **Verify the line number matches the actual file:**
   ```bash
   sed -n 'LINE_NUMBER,LINE_NUMBERp' web/src/app/dashboard/parent/page.tsx
   ```

3. **Check for multiple running dev servers:**
   ```bash
   # Kill all node processes
   pkill -f "next dev"
   
   # Start fresh
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```
