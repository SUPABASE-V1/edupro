### 4. **PayFast Integration (End-to-End)** ✅

#### API Route: `/api/payfast/initiate`
- ✅ Validates user authentication
- ✅ Verifies parent owns the student
- ✅ Creates pending payment record
- ✅ Generates PayFast signature (MD5 hash)
- ✅ Builds payment URL with all parameters
- ✅ Returns redirect URL to PayFast gateway

#### API Route: `/api/payfast/webhook`
- ✅ Receives PayFast ITN (Instant Transaction Notification)
- ✅ Verifies signature for security
- ✅ Updates payment status (completed/failed)
- ✅ Updates student fee assignment balance
- ✅ Triggers auto-status update (pending → paid)
- ✅ Logs all webhook events

#### Payment Flow:
```
Parent clicks "Pay Now"
    ↓
/api/payfast/initiate creates payment
    ↓
Redirect to PayFast gateway
    ↓
Parent completes payment
    ↓
PayFast sends webhook to /api/payfast/webhook
    ↓
Database updates (payment status + balance)
    ↓
Parent sees "Paid" status
```
