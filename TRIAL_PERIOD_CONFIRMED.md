## 💡 Rationale (for future reference)

**Why 7 days?**
- Industry standard for B2B SaaS
- Enough time to test core features
- Creates urgency for decision
- Reduces free-rider problem
- Matches typical school evaluation cycle (1 week)

**Alternative considered**: 14 days
- Rejected: Too long, users delay evaluation
- Data shows: Most trials decide by day 3-5

## 📊 Expected Metrics

| Metric | 7-Day Target | Industry Avg |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Trial Start Rate | 25% | 20-30% |
| Trial → Paid | 15% | 10-25% |
| Activation (day 1) | 60% | 40-60% |
| Cancellation Rate | 5% | 5-15% |
