## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. Sign Up Flow**

```
User signs up as Independent/Homeschool/Supplemental/Exploring
    ↓
Account created successfully
    ↓
✨ 7-day Premium trial started automatically
    ↓
User redirected to verify email
    ↓
User logs in → Sees trial banner
```

### **2. Trial Banner Display**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✨ 7 Days Left in Your Premium Trial              │

```

**Colors:**

```

   - Used for feature gating

4. **`expire_user_trials()`**

SELECT 
  email,
  is_trial,
  trial_end_date
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email = 'davecon12martin@outlook.com';
```

**To give existing user a trial:**
```sql
SELECT start_user_trial(
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'davecon12martin@outlook.com'),
  7,
  'premium'
);
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,

  "plan_tier": "premium"
}
```

### **Test Case 3: Verify Trial Status RPC**

```sql
-- As the user (using their JWT)
SELECT get_my_trial_status();
```

**Expected for Independent User with Trial:**
```json
{
  "is_trial": true,
  "trial_type": "personal",
  "trial_end_date": "2025-11-08",
  "days_remaining": 7,
  "plan_tier": "premium",
  "plan_name": "Premium"
}
```

**Expected for User Without Trial:**
```json
{
  "is_trial": false,
  "message": "No active trial"
}
```

---

### **Test Case 4: Check Premium Access**

-- Check if user has premium access
SELECT has_premium_access(
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com')

## 🎯 Feature Gating Strategy (Phase 2)

### **Later, we'll gate features like this:**

```typescript
// Check if user has premium access
const { data: hasPremium } = await supabase.rpc('has_premium_access');

if (hasPremium) {
  // Show premium features
  <AITutorUnlimited />
  <AdvancedAnalytics />
  <CustomWorksheets />
} else {
  // Show free tier + upgrade prompt
  <AITutorLimited limit={5} />
  <UpgradePrompt />
}
```

**But for now - all features are available! We'll gate later.**

---

## ⚙️ Cron Job Setup (Optional)

To automatically expire trials:

```sql
-- Create pg_cron job (run daily at 2am)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'expire-user-trials',
  '0 2 * * *',
  $$SELECT expire_user_trials();$$
);
```

Or run manually:
```sql
SELECT expire_user_trials();
```

---

## 📈 Analytics Queries

### **How many users have active trials?**

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as active_trials,
  AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM trial_end_date - NOW())) as avg_days_remaining
FROM profiles
WHERE is_trial = TRUE
  AND trial_end_date > NOW();
```

### **Trial conversion rate?**

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_trial = FALSE AND trial_end_date IS NOT NULL) as converted,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_trial = TRUE) as active,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_trial = FALSE AND trial_end_date IS NULL) as never_trialed
FROM profiles
WHERE role = 'parent' AND preschool_id IS NULL;
```

### **Trial expiring soon (next 3 days)?**

```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  p.first_name,
  p.trial_end_date,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM p.trial_end_date - NOW()) as days_left
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = p.id
WHERE p.is_trial = TRUE
  AND p.trial_end_date BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW() + INTERVAL '3 days'
ORDER BY p.trial_end_date ASC;
```
