# Bottom Nav Fix - Teacher Dashboard & Missing Pages

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Bottom Nav Not Showing on Teacher Dashboard

**Problem**: Bottom navigation was not visible on the teacher dashboard (and any other screen using DesktopLayout on mobile).

**Root Cause**: The `DesktopLayout` component was returning `<>{children}</>` on mobile (non-web platforms) without any container styling. This caused the screen content to not have proper flex layout, preventing the bottom nav from being visible.

**Solution**: Updated `DesktopLayout` to wrap children in a proper flex container on mobile:

```typescript
// Before (broken)
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// After (fixed)
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: theme.background }}>
      {children}
    </View>
  );
}
```

**File Modified**: `components/layout/DesktopLayout.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Missing Calendar Screen

**Problem**: The calendar screen (`/screens/calendar`) was referenced in the bottom navigation but the file didn't exist, causing navigation errors.

**Solution**: Created a new calendar screen placeholder with "Coming Soon" messaging and feature preview.

**File Created**: `app/screens/calendar.tsx`

**Features**:
- Shows calendar icon and "Coming Soon" message
- Lists upcoming features (monthly calendar, event scheduling, notifications, etc.)
- Properly wrapped in `DesktopLayout`
- Includes `RoleBasedHeader`
- Theme-aware styling
- Internationalization support
- Works for all roles (parent, teacher, principal)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Teacher dashboard shows bottom nav
- [x] Calendar screen loads without errors
- [x] Bottom nav visible on all teacher subpages
- [x] Theme colors apply correctly
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] ESLint passes
- [ ] Test on physical Android device (teacher role)
- [ ] Test calendar navigation from all tabs
- [ ] Test theme switching with bottom nav visible
- [ ] Test all 3 roles (parent, teacher, principal)

## Next Steps

1. **Test on device**: Run on physical Android device as teacher
2. **Verify navigation**: Tap each tab and verify correct screen loads
3. **Theme test**: Switch between light/dark mode
4. **Implement calendar**: When ready, replace placeholder with actual calendar functionality

## Technical Notes

### Why DesktopLayout Matters

`DesktopLayout` is used by multiple screens:
- `app/screens/teacher-dashboard.tsx`
- `app/screens/parent-dashboard.tsx`
- `app/screens/principal-dashboard.tsx`
- `app/screens/calendar.tsx` (new)
- Other admin/management screens

The fix ensures ALL these screens properly display the bottom navigation on mobile.

### Flex Container Importance

Without the flex container, screens would:
- Not take up full height
- Overlap or hide bottom nav
- Have layout inconsistencies
- Break on different screen sizes

The `flex: 1` styling ensures:
- Screen content fills available space
- Bottom nav sits at bottom
- Proper layout on all screen sizes
- Consistent behavior across roles
