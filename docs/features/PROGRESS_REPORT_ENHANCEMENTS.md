## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Progress bar stuck at 0%**:
- Ensure required fields filled: Period, Grade, Comments
- Check if reportCategory state properly set

**Auto-save not working**:
- Verify AsyncStorage permissions
- Check console for save errors
- Ensure 30s interval hasn't been cleared

**PDF generation fails**:
- Check expo-print compatibility
- Verify file system permissions
- Ensure sufficient device storage

**CSV export empty**:
- Confirm report data structure valid
- Check FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync errors
- Verify sharing permissions

**Character counter not updating**:
- Check if renderCharCounter() receiving correct length
- Verify theme colors not causing invisibility

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging:
```javascript
console.log('[ProgressReport] Draft saved:', draftData);
console.log('[PDF] Generation started:', report);
console.log('[CSV] Export result:', csvResult);
```
