# Dash AI - Voice and Data Access Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stop Button Not Completely Stopping Speech

**Problem:** The stop button in voice mode wasn't completely stopping Dash from speaking, leading to overlapping audio and poor user experience.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `stopSpeaking()` method in `DashAIAssistant.ts` to stop ALL audio sources:
  - Device TTS (expo-speech)
  - Audio manager (Azure TTS)
  - Voice controller (Phase 4 architecture)
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Made the method throw errors so callers know when stop failed
- Improved stop button handlers in `DashVoiceMode.tsx` and `DashSpeakingOverlay.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `services/DashAIAssistant.ts`
- `components/ai/DashVoiceMode.tsx`
- `components/ai/DashSpeakingOverlay.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Dash Not Responding Concisely with School Data

**Problem:** When asked "how many students do we have?", Dash would give generic overview instead of actual data from the school database.

**Solution:**
- Added new `get_organization_stats` tool to `DashToolRegistry.ts` that:
  - Fetches actual student count from database
  - Gets teacher count
  - Gets classroom count
  - Provides organization name and location
  - Returns comprehensive statistics with proper breakdown
- Integrated tool registry with `DashAIAssistant.ts` to enable AI to call these tools
- Enhanced `callAIService()` method to:
  - Pass tool specifications to AI gateway
  - Handle tool use responses
  - Execute tool calls and return results to AI
  - Support follow-up requests with tool results

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "How many students do we have?"
Dash: "Your organization has 45 active students, 8 teachers, and 5 classes."
```

**Files Modified:**
- `services/modules/DashToolRegistry.ts` (added `get_organization_stats` tool)
- `services/DashAIAssistant.ts` (added tool registry integration)

### 3. ✅ Awkward Text-to-Speech Phrasing

**Problem:** TTS was reading awkward phrases like "children to 6 years old" instead of natural "6 year old children".

**Solution:**
- Added new `normalizeAgeAndQuantityPhrases()` method to improve text normalization
- Handles common awkward patterns:
  - "children to 6 years old" → "6 year old children"
  - "students from 5 to 7 years" → "students aged 5 to 7 years"
  - "kids aged 3-4 years old" → "3 to 4 year old kids"
  - "students of 6 years" → "6 year old students"
  - "6 year students" → "6 year old students"
  - "6 years old student" → "6 year old student"
- Applied to both `DashAIAssistant.ts` and `DashVoiceController.ts` for consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `services/DashAIAssistant.ts`
- `services/modules/DashVoiceController.ts`

### 4. ✅ PDF Generation with Improper Names

**Problem:** Generated PDFs had random filenames like `dash_2025-10-19_untitled-document_a3f2k5.pdf` instead of meaningful contextual names.

**Solution:**

#### Improved Filename Generation:
- Removed random suffixes
- Added document type prefixes (e.g., `lesson-plan-`, `worksheet-`)
- Better title sanitization (preserves meaning while removing special chars)
- Format: `[type-]title_date.pdf`

**Example:**
- Before: `dash_2025-10-19_untitled-document_a3f2k5.pdf`
- After: `lesson-plan-introduction-to-fractions_2025-10-19.pdf`

#### Enhanced Title Extraction:
- Detects explicit title markers: "title:", "name:", "called"
- Identifies topics: "about X", "on X", "regarding X"
- Recognizes creation patterns: "create a X for Y"
- Smart fallbacks to first line or sentence

**Files Modified:**
- `services/DashPDFGenerator.ts`

## Testing Recommendations

### Voice Mode Testing
1. **Stop Button:**
   - Start Dash speaking
   - Press stop button mid-speech
   - Verify all audio stops immediately
   - Verify Dash is ready for next input

2. **TTS Quality:**
   - Ask about student ages (e.g., "Tell me about 6 year old students")
   - Verify natural phrasing in speech output
   - Test with various age-related queries

### Data Access Testing
1. **Organization Stats:**
   - Ask: "How many students do we have?"
   - Ask: "What are our school statistics?"
   - Ask: "Tell me about our organization"
   - Verify Dash returns actual data from database

2. **Member Information:**
   - Ask: "Show me the student list"
   - Ask: "How is [student name] performing?"
   - Verify accurate data retrieval

### PDF Generation Testing
1. **Filename Quality:**
   - Generate various PDFs (lessons, worksheets, reports)
   - Check that filenames are meaningful and descriptive
   - Verify document type prefixes are appropriate

2. **Title Extraction:**
   - Test prompts like: "Create a lesson plan about fractions"
   - Test prompts like: "Make a worksheet called 'Math Practice'"
   - Verify titles are extracted correctly
