# Voice Input Test Verification (Single-Use Mode)

**Feature:** Mic button in DashAssistant chat input  
**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-20  
**Issue:** Transcript was lost when `onFinal` triggered without `dashInstance`  
**Fix:** Prioritize `onTranscriptReady` callback before AI processing

## Debugging Logs to Watch

**Good Flow (Expected):**

[VoiceModalAzure] Provider selected: azure
[VoiceModalAzure] ‚úÖ Voice session ready
[VoiceModalAzure] ‚úÖ Final transcript: This is a test
[VoiceModalAzure] üìù Input mode: returning transcript to callback
[DashAssistant] (no further logs - no AI call)
```

**Bad Flow (Bug):**
```
[VoiceModalAzure] ‚úÖ Final transcript: This is a test
[VoiceModalAzure] ‚ö†Ô∏è No dashInstance for AI processing
