## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
1. Check session on mount
2. If no session ‚Üí redirect to /sign-in
3. Load user profile and preschool data
4. Fetch dashboard metrics from Supabase
5. Display dashboard with real-time data
```

### Data Sources
All metrics are fetched from Supabase:
- **Students**: `students` table filtered by `preschool_id` and `status='active'`
- **Teachers**: `profiles` table filtered by `organization_id` and `role='teacher'`
- **Classes**: `classes` table filtered by `preschool_id`
- **Financial** data: Placeholder (TODO: implement financial tracking)

### Design Consistency
- Matches parent and teacher dashboard styling
- Uses existing design system components
- Gradient header with preschool name
- Grid layout for metrics
- Card-based UI

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds without errors
- [x] Route renders at /dashboard/principal
- [x] Auth guard redirects unauthenticated users
- [x] No hydration errors
- [x] Loading states work correctly
- [ ] Test with real principal account
- [ ] Verify metrics load from database
- [ ] Test quick action navigation
- [ ] Test across different screen sizes
- [ ] Test dark mode (if applicable)

## Integration with Native App

The web principal dashboard mirrors the React Native implementation:
- Same metrics structure
- Similar navigation items
- Consistent data sources (Supabase)
- Matching role-based access control

**Differences**:
- Web uses PrincipalShell (sidebar nav)
- Native uses BottomTabBar + DesktopLayout
- Web has more detailed quick actions
- Native focuses on mobile-first interactions

## Access Control

**Required Role**: `principal` or `principal_admin`

**Auth Check**:
```typescript
// Enforced in page.tsx
if (!session) router.push('/sign-in');
```

**Future**: Add role verification middleware to ensure only principals can access `/dashboard/principal/*`

## Summary

‚úÖ **Principal dashboard fully implemented** with:
- Shell component with navigation
- Main dashboard page with metrics
- Quick actions for common tasks
- Real-time data from Supabase
- Consistent design with existing dashboards
