## üìù What This Fixes

The RLS policies were blocking uploads because:
- Old policies used complex `storage.foldername()` logic
- New simple policies use regex pattern matching: `name ~ ('^' || auth.uid()::text || '/')`
- This matches the path format: `{user_id}/{filename}.m4a`

### Example:
- User ID: `136cf31c-b37c-45c0-9cf7-755bd1b9afbf`
- File path: `136cf31c-b37c-45c0-9cf7-755bd1b9afbf/dash_1728293045123_abc123.m4a`
- Policy check: ‚úÖ Path starts with user's ID

## üß™ Alternative: Use Supabase CLI

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/king/Desktop/edudashpro

# Run the migration
npx supabase db push --db-url "your-connection-string"
```

**OR** use the Studio interface (easiest):
1. Go to Storage settings
2. Click "Policies" tab for voice-notes bucket
3. Delete all existing policies
4. Create new policies with the SQL from `FIX_VOICE_RLS_RUN_IN_SUPABASE.sql`

## üìû Need Help?

If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Check you're signed in**: The error could also be authentication-related
2. **Check bucket exists**: Verify `voice-notes` bucket exists in Storage
3. **Check logs**: Look for more detailed error messages in Supabase logs
4. **Try test upload**: Use Supabase Storage UI to manually upload a file to `your-user-id/test.m4a`
