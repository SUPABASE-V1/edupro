# Implementation Status - October 22, 2025

## Summary

We've addressed three critical issues related to teacher AI access and organizational membership:

1. ‚úÖ **Identified root cause** - Teacher AI access requires both paid plan tier AND active organization membership
2. ‚úÖ **Created test suite** - Scripts to test invite flow end-to-end
3. ‚úÖ **Created legacy migration tool** - Script to fix teachers without proper memberships
4. ‚úÖ **Designed independent teacher mode** - Full freemium model for teachers without schools

## üö® Immediate Fix Required

### Young Eagles Teacher AI Access

**Problem**: Teacher (d699bb7d-7b9e-4a2f-9bf3-72e2d1fe7e64) cannot access AI because:
- Organization is on "free" plan (should be "pro")
- Teacher may be missing `organization_members` entry

**Solution**: Apply manual fix via Supabase Dashboard

### Steps to Fix Now

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor**:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lvvvjywrmpcqrpvuptdi/sql/new

2. **Run this query to upgrade org**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE organizations 
   SET plan_tier = 'pro'
   WHERE id = 'bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b';
   ```

3. **Find the correct user_id**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     p.id as profile_id,
     p.email,
     u.id as user_id_in_users_table,
     p.organization_id
   FROM profiles p
   LEFT JOIN users u ON u.auth_user_id = p.id
   WHERE p.id = 'd699bb7d-7b9e-4a2f-9bf3-72e2d1fe7e64';
   ```

4. **Create membership** (use the `user_id_in_users_table` from above):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO organization_members (
     id,
     organization_id,
     user_id,
     role,
     seat_status
   ) VALUES (
     gen_random_uuid(),
     'bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b',
     'ACTUAL_USER_ID_FROM_STEP_3', -- << REPLACE THIS
     'teacher',
     'active'
   )
   ON CONFLICT (organization_id, user_id) 
   DO UPDATE SET seat_status = 'active';
   ```

5. **Verify the fix**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     o.name as org_name,
     o.plan_tier,
     p.email as teacher_email,
     om.seat_status
   FROM organizations o
   JOIN profiles p ON p.organization_id = o.id
   LEFT JOIN organization_members om ON om.organization_id = o.id 
     AND om.user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = p.id)
   WHERE o.id = 'bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b'
     AND p.id = 'd699bb7d-7b9e-4a2f-9bf3-72e2d1fe7e64';
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- `org_name`: Young Eagles
- `plan_tier`: pro
- `teacher_email`: <teacher's email>
- `seat_status`: active

## üì¶ What We've Created

### 1. Test Scripts

**File**: `scripts/test-teacher-invite-flow.ts`

Tests the complete teacher invitation and acceptance flow:
- Creates invite as principal
- Simulates teacher signup
- Verifies membership creation
- Tests AI capability access

**To run** (requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` exported):
```bash
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"
npx tsx scripts/test-teacher-invite-flow.ts
```

### 2. Legacy Teacher Migration

**File**: `scripts/migrate-legacy-teachers.ts`

Finds teachers with `organization_id` but no `organization_members` entry and creates proper memberships.

**To run**:
```bash
# Dry run (preview only)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-legacy-teachers.ts --dry-run

# For specific org
npx tsx scripts/migrate-legacy-teachers.ts --dry-run --org-id=bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b

# Actually migrate
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"
npx tsx scripts/migrate-legacy-teachers.ts
```

### 3. Independent Teacher Mode Design

**File**: `docs/features/independent-teacher-mode.md`

Complete design for teachers who want to use the app without school enrollment:

**Features**:
- **Free Tier**: 10 students max, 10 AI queries/month
- **Pro Tier** ($9.99/mo): 50 students, 500 AI queries, voice assistant
- Auto-creates personal workspace
- Migration path when joining school later
- Stripe payment integration

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Database schema (add `account_type`, `student_limit` to organizations)
2. Signup flow (choice screen: join school vs independent)
3. Feature restrictions (student limits, upgrade prompts)
4. Payment integration (Stripe)
5. Migration path (independent ‚Üí school)

### 4. Fix Scripts

**Files**:
- `scripts/fix-young-eagles-teacher.ts` - Automated fix (requires service key)
- `sql/manual-fix-young-eagles.sql` - Manual steps for dashboard

---

## üîç Key Findings

### Database Schema Discovery

1. **Organizations table** uses `plan_tier` NOT `subscription_plan`
   - Columns: `id`, `name`, `plan_tier`, `is_active`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `country`
   - Valid plan_tiers: `'free'`, `'starter'`, `'premium'`, `'pro'`, `'enterprise'`

2. **Organization membership** is REQUIRED for capabilities
   - Table: `organization_members`
   - Columns: `organization_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `seat_status`, `invited_by`
   - Unique constraint: `(organization_id, user_id)`
   - Foreign key: `user_id` references `users.id` (NOT `profiles.id`)

3. **AI capability logic** (from `lib/rbac.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Teacher gets AI ONLY if:
   const hasPaidPlan = ['premium', 'pro', 'enterprise'].includes(org.plan_tier);
   const hasActiveSeat = membership.seat_status === 'active';
   const hasAI = hasPaidPlan && hasActiveSeat;
   ```

### Invite Flow Mechanics

**Teacher Invite Service** (`lib/services/teacherInviteService.ts`):

1. Principal creates invite ‚Üí `teacher_invites` table
2. Teacher accepts ‚Üí `TeacherInviteService.accept()`
3. Accept function **automatically**:
   - Updates profiles table with `organization_id`
   - Creates `organization_members` entry with `seat_status: 'active'`
4. Membership creation enables capabilities via RBAC

**Legacy Issue**: Teachers created before `organization_members` table lack this entry.

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

- [x] Apply manual fix via Supabase Dashboard (steps above)
- [ ] Test teacher AI access in app
- [ ] Run legacy migration script if other teachers affected

### Short Term (This Week)

---

## üéâ Update: October 25, 2025 - Parent-School Auto-Linkage System

### Problem Solved

**Issue**: Parents were losing their `preschool_id` linkage when updating profile details, causing:
- Permission denied errors when accessing school-specific features
- Inability to see their children's data
- Disconnection from the school even though children were enrolled

**Root Cause**: Profile updates could overwrite/NULL the `preschool_id` field if not explicitly preserved.

### Solution Implemented

#### ‚úÖ 1. Database Trigger (Automatic Sync)

**Migration**: `20251025202900_auto_link_parent_to_school_on_child_claim.sql`

**Trigger**: `sync_parent_preschool_on_student_update`  
**Function**: `sync_parent_preschool_from_student()`

**What it does**:
- Fires on INSERT or UPDATE of `students.parent_id`, `students.guardian_id`, or `students.preschool_id`
- Automatically syncs parent/guardian `preschool_id` from student's `preschool_id`
- Updates **both** `profiles` table (primary) and `users` table (legacy)
- Only updates if `preschool_id` is NULL or different (idempotent)

**Result**: Parents are automatically linked to the correct school when claiming children, regardless of registration order.

#### ‚úÖ 2. Application Layer Enhancement

**File**: `lib/services/parentJoinService.ts`

**Enhanced**: `ParentJoinService.approve()` now explicitly syncs `preschool_id` when principal approves guardian requests.

```typescript
// When principal approves parent-child link:
if (student.preschool_id) {
  await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .update({ 
      preschool_id: student.preschool_id,
      organization_id: student.preschool_id
    })
    .eq('id', parentAuthId)
    .eq('role', 'parent');
}
```

**Why both layers?**
- **Trigger**: Catches ALL student updates (app, direct SQL, imports, admin tools)
- **Application**: Provides immediate feedback and explicit control

#### ‚úÖ 3. One-Time Restoration

The migration includes a one-time fix that restored `preschool_id` for existing parents who had children but lost linkage:

```sql
-- Find parents with children but missing preschool_id
-- Restore from their first child's preschool_id
WITH parent_preschool_mapping AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT s.parent_id, s.preschool_id
  FROM students s
  WHERE s.parent_id IS NOT NULL 
    AND s.preschool_id IS NOT NULL
    AND s.is_active = true
)
UPDATE profiles p
SET preschool_id = ppm.preschool_id,
    organization_id = ppm.preschool_id
FROM parent_preschool_mapping ppm
WHERE p.id = ppm.profile_id
  AND p.role = 'parent'
  AND p.preschool_id IS NULL;
```

#### ‚úÖ 4. Progress Report Real-Time Updates

**Also Fixed**: Principal report review screen now has:
- Real-time subscription to `progress_reports` table via Supabase channels
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Fallback polling (30s interval)
- Proper SafeAreaView wrapping
- Theme-aware UI components
- Fixed undefined `userProfile` reference in signature display

**Migrations Applied**:
- `20251025153717_add_signature_workflow_to_progress_reports.sql`
- `20251025163635_add_progress_report_approval_workflow.sql`

### Documentation Added

**File**: `docs/features/PARENT_SCHOOL_AUTO_LINKAGE.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Problem statement and root cause analysis
- Solution architecture ("Child is the Source of Truth" strategy)
- Data flow diagrams for all scenarios
- Testing scenarios and validation queries
- Deployment guide and rollback plan
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement roadmap

### Testing Scenarios Covered

‚úÖ **Scenario 1**: School registers child first ‚Üí Parent claims ‚Üí Auto-linked  
‚úÖ **Scenario 2**: Parent registers first ‚Üí Child added ‚Üí Linkage maintained  
‚úÖ **Scenario 3**: Parent loses linkage ‚Üí Claims child ‚Üí Automatically restored  
‚úÖ **Scenario 4**: Guardian (not parent) links to child ‚Üí preschool_id set  
‚úÖ **Scenario 5**: Profile update ‚Üí preschool_id preserved via trigger

### Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Migration applied to production database
- ‚úÖ Trigger active and operational
- ‚úÖ Schema drift verified (no drift)
- ‚úÖ Code committed and pushed to development branch
- ‚úÖ Pull request ready: `feat/progress-report-creator-styles-student-editor`

**Branch**: `feat/progress-report-creator-styles-student-editor`  
**Commit**: `1830048`  
**Files Changed**: 40 files, 9163 insertions, 1578 deletions

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check parents with children but no school linkage (should be 0)
SELECT p.id, p.email, p.first_name, p.last_name, p.preschool_id
FROM profiles p
JOIN students s ON s.parent_id = p.id
WHERE p.role = 'parent'
  AND p.preschool_id IS NULL
  AND s.is_active = true;

-- Verify trigger is active
SELECT tgname, tgtype, tgenabled
FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname = 'sync_parent_preschool_on_student_update';

-- Count parents with/without school linkage
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE preschool_id IS NOT NULL) as linked_parents,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE preschool_id IS NULL) as unlinked_parents,
  COUNT(*) as total_parents
FROM profiles
WHERE role = 'parent';
```

### Impact

**Problem Resolution**:
- Parents can now update profiles without losing school access
- Child-first enrollment (school registers child ‚Üí parent claims) works seamlessly
- Existing broken linkages automatically fixed by migration
- Future linkages maintained automatically via trigger

**User Experience**:
- Parents will no longer see "permission denied" errors
- Children's data accessible immediately after linking
- Profile updates no longer break school connectivity
- Self-healing system restores linkages automatically

**Technical Benefits**:
- Resilient across all registration order scenarios
- Automatic sync eliminates manual intervention
- Backward compatible with legacy `users` table
- Auditable with comprehensive documentation
- Future-proof with Phase 2/3 enhancement roadmap

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If teacher still can't access AI after fix:

1. **Verify organization plan**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, plan_tier FROM organizations 
   WHERE id = 'bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b';
   ```
   Should show: `plan_tier = 'pro'`

2. **Verify membership exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM organization_members
   WHERE organization_id = 'bd5fe69c-8bee-445d-811d-a6db37f0e49b';
   ```
   Should have entry with `seat_status = 'active'`

3. **Check RBAC logic**:
   - File: `lib/rbac.ts`
   - Function: `getCapabilitiesForUserInOrganization()`
   - Verify it checks `plan_tier` not `subscription_plan`

4. **Check client-side capability check**:
   - Teacher dashboard should call `useCapabilities()` hook
   - Hook should return `hasCapability('use_ai_assistant') === true`

### If migration script fails:

1. **Check service role key**:
   ```bash
   echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   ```

2. **Verify key is exported**:
   ```bash
   export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="eyJh..."
   ```

3. **Test connection**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-teacher-invite-flow.ts
   ```
