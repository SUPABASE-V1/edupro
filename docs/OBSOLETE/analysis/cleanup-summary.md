# Authentication Debug Code Cleanup

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up all development bypass and debug code that was added as temporary workarounds for the "Database error granting user" authentication issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sign-in Page (`app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed development bypass state variables (`devBypassEnabled`, `devUsers`)
- ✅ Removed `checkDevBypass()` function and its useEffect call
- ✅ Removed development bypass logic from `onSignInWithPassword()` function
- ✅ Removed database error detection and automatic OTP switching
- ✅ Cleaned up UI warning elements for server status
- ✅ Removed development mode indicator from UI
- ✅ Simplified toggle button styling (removed recommendation highlighting)
- ✅ Removed all related CSS styles for warnings and dev indicators

### 2. Development Bypass Module
- ✅ Deleted `lib/devAuthBypass.ts` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Deleted `DEVELOPMENT_AUTH_BYPASS.md` documentation

### 3. Debug Scripts
- ✅ Archived `fix-auth-database-error.js` to `archive/` folder
- ✅ Kept other diagnostic scripts (`diagnose-principal-dashboard.js`, etc.) as they're legitimate operational tools

## What Was Preserved
- ✅ All existing OTP/email code authentication functionality
- ✅ All biometric authentication features
- ✅ All legitimate diagnostic scripts for other features
- ✅ All core authentication flow logic

## Result
The sign-in page is now back to its clean, production-ready state with:
- Standard password authentication
- OTP/email code authentication as alternative
- Biometric authentication support
- No development-only code or warnings
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Files Modified
1. `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx` - Cleaned up authentication logic and UI
2. `lib/devAuthBypass.ts` - Deleted (no longer needed)
3. `DEVELOPMENT_AUTH_BYPASS.md` - Deleted (no longer needed)
4. `fix-auth-database-error.js` - Archived to `archive/` folder

The authentication system is now functioning normally without any temporary workarounds or development-only code.
