      'grading_assistance',
      'student_progress_tracking',
      'curriculum_alignment',
      'assessment_creation'
    ],
    proactive_behaviors: [
      'suggest_lesson_improvements',
      'remind_upcoming_deadlines',
      'flag_student_concerns',
      'recommend_resources'
    ]
  },
  principal: {
    capabilities: [
      'staff_management',
      'budget_analysis',
      'policy_recommendations',
      'strategic_planning',
      'compliance_tracking'
    ],
    proactive_behaviors: [
      'monitor_school_metrics',
      'suggest_policy_updates',

public async generateProactivesuggestions(): Promise<{
  suggestions: Array<{
    type: 'task' | 'reminder' | 'insight' | 'action';
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  }>;
  insights: string[];
}>
```

**Proactive Behaviors Implemented:**
- ✅ Time-based suggestions (Monday planning, Friday wrap-up)
- ✅ Pattern-based recommendations (recent activity analysis)
- ✅ Context-aware help (error recovery)
- ✅ Role-specific suggestions (teacher vs principal)
- ✅ Seasonal recommendations (assessment periods)

**Enhancement Opportunities:**

- ✅ Gesture controls

**Agentic Strengths:**
- ✅ Seamless mode switching
- ✅ Context preservation across modalities
- ✅ Voice note storage and retrieval
- ✅ Attachment processing and understanding

---

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified: Microphone Permission Persistence

### Problem Analysis

**Issue:** Dash constantly reverts to requesting microphone permissions even after being granted.

**Root Cause (Lines 544, 677):**

```typescript
// In initializeAudio() - Line 544
const permissionResult = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync();
if (!permissionResult.granted) {
  console.warn('[Dash] Audio recording permission denied');
  return; // Silent failure - doesn't persist state
}

// In startRecording() - Line 677
const permissionResult = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync();
if (!permissionResult.granted) {
  throw new Error('Microphone permission is required...');
}
```

**Problems:**
1. ❌ No permission state caching
2. ❌ Requests permission on every recording attempt
3. ❌ Silent failure in initialization doesn't inform user
4. ❌ No persistent permission status tracking
5. ❌ Doesn't check existing permissions before requesting
