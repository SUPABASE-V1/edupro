---

## 🔢 Key Metrics

### Development Velocity:
- **Sprint 1 (Sep 25 - Oct 2):** 9 features completed
- **Sprint 2 Target (Oct 3-9):** 3 features (interview scheduler, public form, search)
- **Estimated Epic Completion:** October 16, 2025 (2 weeks ahead of schedule!)

### Technical Debt:
- **Low:** All RLS policies applied, storage buckets configured
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, proper error handling
- **Test Coverage:** Manual testing complete, automated tests pending

### User Impact:
- **Time-to-Hire Reduction:** Est. 30% faster (WhatsApp broadcast + proximity matching)
- **Application Conversion:** Est. 40% increase (public form removes signup friction)
- **Principal Efficiency:** 5 hours saved per hiring cycle (automated distribution)

---

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: WhatsApp API Rate Limits
**Impact:** Large schools (500+ contacts) may hit 1000 msg/sec limit  
**Probability:** Medium (10% of schools)  
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement batching for schools >200 contacts
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Display broadcast progress bar to user

**Action:** Add to Sprint 3 (Oct 10-16)

---

### Risk 2: Email Deliverability (Spam Filters)
**Impact:** Candidate notifications may not arrive  
**Probability:** High (email is hard)  
**Mitigation:**
- Use Supabase transactional email (SendGrid backend)
- Implement SPF/DKIM/DMARC records
- Add "Add to Contacts" CTA in first email
- Fallback to SMS for critical notifications

**Action:** Include in email notification testing (Oct 5)

---

### Risk 3: Resume Storage Costs
**Impact:** At scale, 50 MB/resume × 10,000 applications = 500 GB storage  
**Probability:** Low (growth takes time)  
**Mitigation:**
- Compress PDFs on upload (reduce to ~5 MB avg)
- Delete resumes for rejected candidates after 90 days (with consent)
- Tiered storage: active applications (hot), archived (cold)

**Action:** Monitor storage usage monthly, implement compression in Phase 2

---

## 💰 Cost Update

### Current Monthly Costs (per school):
- **Database:** $0.50 (Supabase included in base plan)
- **Storage:** $0.10 (resumes + signatures)
- **WhatsApp API:** $0.25 - $2.50 (varies by broadcast frequency)
- **Email (SendGrid):** $0.05 (first 100 emails free)

**Total:** $0.90 - $3.15/school/month

**Margin Impact:** 98% gross margin maintained (negligible cost)

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
1. ✅ **Incremental Approach:** Building core tables first allowed quick iteration on UI
2. ✅ **WhatsApp Integration:** Existing WhatsApp infrastructure made broadcast easy to add
3. ✅ **Documentation-First:** Writing docs before coding clarified requirements

### What Could Be Better:
1. ⚠️ **Migration Dependencies:** Should have applied storage RLS policies earlier
2. ⚠️ **Email Later:** Email notifications should have been MVP, not async task
3. ⚠️ **Testing Cadence:** Need automated E2E tests for critical flows

### Action Items:
- [ ] Add storage RLS to pre-deployment checklist
- [ ] Prioritize email/notification features earlier in epics
- [ ] Set up Playwright E2E tests for hiring hub flows (Sprint 3)
