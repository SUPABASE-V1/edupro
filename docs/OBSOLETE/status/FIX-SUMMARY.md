# EAS Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Translation Keys Showing Instead of Translated Text** ✅ FIXED
**Symptom:** Debug APK shows proper translations, but EAS builds show raw keys like `dashboard.quick_actions_section`

**Root Cause:** Translation JSON files in `locales/` directory were not being bundled into production builds.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `metro.config.js` to treat JSON files as source files
- Added `assetBundlePatterns` to `app.config.js` to explicitly include locale files
- Added `assetBundlePatterns` to `app.json` as backup

### 2. **App Freezing/White Screen on Certain Routes** ✅ FIXED
**Symptom:** Opening routes like Petty Cash causes app to hang, then shows blank white screen

**Root Cause:** i18n library was never initialized before components tried to use `useTranslation()` hook. This caused:
- Uncaught errors when components tried to access translations
- No error boundary to catch and display these errors
- Silent failures resulting in white screens

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `import '@/lib/i18n'` to `app/_layout.tsx` to initialize i18n before any components render
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and gracefully display errors
- Wrapped entire app in `ErrorBoundary` in root layout

## Files Modified

### 1. `metro.config.js`
```javascript
// Added JSON as source files
config.resolver.assetExts = config.resolver.assetExts.filter(ext => ext !== 'json');
config.resolver.sourceExts = [...config.resolver.sourceExts, 'json'];
```

### 2. `app.config.js`
```javascript
// Added asset bundle patterns
assetBundlePatterns: [
  '**/*',
  'locales/**/*.json',
]
```

### 3. `app.json`
```javascript
// Added asset bundle patterns (backup)
"assetBundlePatterns": [
  "**/*",
  "locales/**/*.json"
]
```

### 4. `app/_layout.tsx`
```javascript
// Added i18n initialization (CRITICAL)
import '@/lib/i18n';
import ErrorBoundary from '@/components/ErrorBoundary';

// Wrapped app in ErrorBoundary
return (
  <ErrorBoundary>
    {/* existing providers */}
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```

### 5. `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (NEW FILE)
- Created comprehensive error boundary component
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Displays debug info in development mode
- Provides "Try Again" button to recover

### 6. `eas.json`
```javascript
// Added credentialsSource to all profiles
"credentialsSource": "remote"
```

### 7. `google-services.json`
- Copied from `app/google-services.json` to project root
- Now properly referenced in `app.config.js`
- Will be auto-uploaded during EAS builds

## Files Created

1. **`components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`** - Error boundary for graceful error handling
2. **`route-comparison.md`** - Documentation of all routes and exclusions
3. **`FIX-SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Why Debug APK Worked But EAS Builds Didn't

### Debug APK (Local)
- Metro bundler runs in development mode
- Hot reloading enabled
- All files accessible locally
- More lenient error handling
- i18n may have been lazy-loaded successfully

### EAS Production Build
- Stricter bundling rules
- Tree-shaking removes "unused" code
- No hot reloading
- i18n must be initialized explicitly
- Missing files cause immediate crashes
- No error recovery without error boundaries

## Testing Checklist

After the new build completes, verify:

### ✅ Translations Working
- [ ] Dashboard shows translated text (not `dashboard.quick_actions_section`)
- [ ] All UI elements show proper language
- [ ] Language switcher works correctly

### ✅ Routes Accessible
- [ ] Petty Cash System opens without freezing
- [ ] Financial Dashboard loads properly
- [ ] All Principal Hub features accessible
- [ ] Teacher Dashboard works
- [ ] Parent Dashboard works

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] If an error occurs, ErrorBoundary shows friendly message
- [ ] "Try Again" button allows recovery
- [ ] No more blank white screens

### ✅ Google Services
- [ ] Firebase features work (push notifications, analytics, etc.)
- [ ] No Firebase initialization errors in logs

## Next Steps

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```

2. **Install and test:**
   - Download APK from EAS dashboard
   - Install on physical device
   - Test all routes mentioned above
   - Check translations are working
   - Verify error handling

3. **Monitor logs:**
   - Use `adb logcat` or device logs to catch any remaining issues
   - Check for any new errors in console

4. **If issues persist:**
   - Check the ErrorBoundary message for specific error details
   - Review device logs for stack traces
   - Verify all required dependencies are installed

## Technical Notes

### Why i18n Initialization is Critical
React i18next requires initialization before any component tries to use `useTranslation()`. Without this:
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Component tries to use i18n before it's initialized
function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation(); // CRASH! i18n not ready
  return <Text>{t('key')}</Text>;
}

// ✅ GOOD: i18n initialized in root layout first
// app/_layout.tsx
import '@/lib/i18n'; // Initialize here

// Then in components, it's safe:
function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation(); // Works!
  return <Text>{t('key')}</Text>;
}
```

### Metro Bundler JSON Handling
Metro needs explicit configuration to include JSON as source files:
- By default, some JSON files are treated as assets (not bundled properly)
- Translation files need to be in the JavaScript bundle, not as separate assets
- The `sourceExts` configuration ensures this

### Error Boundaries in React Native
- React doesn't provide built-in error boundaries for React Native
- Custom implementation required
- Critical for production apps to prevent white screens
- Should be at root level to catch all errors

## Production Readiness

Before deploying to production (`eas build --profile production`):
- [ ] Test thoroughly in preview build first
- [ ] Verify all translations for all supported languages
- [ ] Test on multiple devices (low-end and high-end)
- [ ] Monitor error tracking/analytics for any issues
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

## Support

If issues persist after these fixes:
1. Check `ErrorBoundary` error message for specific errors
2. Run `adb logcat | grep ReactNative` to see detailed logs
3. Test in development mode first: `npx expo start --clear`
4. Verify all packages are installed: `npm install`
5. Clear caches: `npx expo start --clear` and `npm run clean` (if available)
