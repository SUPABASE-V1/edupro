# EduDash Pro - Missing Features & Fixes Required

## Overview

This document identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and required fixes discovered during the comprehensive operations analysis. Items are prioritized by impact on user experience and system reliability.

---

## Priority 1 - Critical Issues (Block User Workflows)

### A1. Navigation Routes - Missing Screen Implementations

Several routes referenced in the codebase don't have corresponding screen implementations:

**Missing Routes:**
- `/screens/ai-lesson-generator` (Referenced in TeacherDashboard)
- `/screens/ai-homework-grader-live` (Referenced in TeacherDashboard)
- `/screens/ai-progress-analysis` (Referenced in TeacherDashboard)
- `/screens/financial-dashboard` (Referenced in PrincipalDashboard)
- `/screens/financial-reports` (Referenced in PrincipalDashboard)
- `/screens/finance/petty-cash` (Referenced in PrincipalDashboard)
- `/screens/class-teacher-management` (Referenced in PrincipalDashboard)
- `/screens/parent-children` (Referenced in ParentDashboard)
- `/screens/parent-child-registration` (Referenced in ParentDashboard)
- `/screens/admin-ai-allocation` (Referenced in TeacherDashboard)
- `/pricing` (Referenced in various upgrade flows)

**Why This Matters:** Users clicking these navigation buttons get navigation errors or blank screens.

**Proposed Fix:** 
1. Create placeholder screens with "Coming Soon" UI for missing routes
2. Implement core screens in order of user impact (AI tools first, financial tools second)
3. Add proper error boundaries and fallback components

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All referenced routes have corresponding screen files
- [ ] Placeholder screens show clear "feature coming soon" messaging
- [ ] No navigation crashes or error screens for users

### A2. AI Enablement Logic Inconsistency

Different components use conflicting conditions to determine AI feature availability:

**Current Inconsistency:**
```typescript
// TeacherDashboard.tsx - Permissive (enabled unless explicitly false)
const AI_ENABLED = (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_ENABLED !== "false") && 
                   (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES !== "false");

// ai-homework-helper.tsx - Restrictive (enabled only if explicitly true)
const AI_ENABLED = (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_ENABLED === 'true') || 
                   (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES === 'true');
```

**Why This Matters:** Teachers may see AI tools enabled in dashboard but disabled when accessing specific AI screens, creating confusing UX.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Create shared utility function `getAIFeatureStatus()` in `/lib/ai/`
2. Standardize on permissive logic (enabled unless 'false') for consistency
3. Update all components to use shared utility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Single source of truth for AI enablement logic
- [ ] All AI-related components use shared utility
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all screens

---

## Priority 2 - High Impact Issues (Degrade User Experience)

### B1. Missing Hook Implementation Contracts

Several hooks are referenced but their implementation contracts are unclear or missing:

**Missing/Unclear Hooks:**
- `useTeacherDashboard()` - Return type and data contract undefined
- `useWhatsAppConnection()` - Connection status interface unclear
- `useHomeworkGenerator()` - Generate function signature unclear

**Why This Matters:** Components may fail at runtime if hook implementations don't match expected interfaces.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for all hook return types
2. Document expected data contracts in hook files
3. Add runtime validation for critical hook responses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All custom hooks have defined TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Hook documentation includes usage examples
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in components using these hooks

### B2. Missing Component Dependencies

`RoleBasedHeader` references several functions that may not be implemented:

**Missing Dependencies:**
- `signOutAndRedirect()` - Sign out flow function
- `getSettingsRoute()` - Role-based settings routing
- `LanguageSelector` - Language selection component

**Why This Matters:** Header component may crash on user interactions (menu taps, sign out).

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Verify existence of all referenced functions and components
2. Create stub implementations for missing dependencies
3. Add error boundaries around component interactions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All RoleBasedHeader dependencies exist and work
- [ ] No runtime errors when using header menu
- [ ] Proper fallbacks for missing functionality

### B3. Internationalization Gaps

Components use `defaultValue` for translations instead of proper localization keys:

**Missing Translation Keys:**
- `dashboard.ai_upgrade_required_title`
- `dashboard.ai_upgrade_required_message`
- `dashboard.ai_tools_enabled`
- `dashboard.ai_tools_disabled`
- `dashboard.ai_tools_info`
- Various other defaultValue strings

**Why This Matters:** Translations won't work for non-English users, breaking i18n support.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Audit all components for `defaultValue` usage
2. Add missing keys to all language files (`/locales/*/common.json`)
3. Remove `defaultValue` fallbacks where keys exist

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All user-facing strings have proper translation keys
- [ ] No `defaultValue` usage for critical UI elements
- [ ] All supported languages have complete translations

---

## Priority 3 - Medium Impact Issues (Technical Debt)

### C1. Unused Imports and Dead Code

Several components import functions/components that aren't used:

**TeacherDashboard.tsx:**
- `createCheckout` imported but never called
- `CacheIndicator` imported but usage unclear
- `AdBannerWithUpgrade` imported but placement needs verification
- `aiTempUnlocks` state declared but inconsistently used

**Why This Matters:** Bundle size bloat, maintenance confusion, potential runtime errors.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Remove unused imports from all components
2. Either implement or remove incomplete features (aiTempUnlocks)
3. Verify ad placement components are working correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No unused imports in any component
- [ ] All declared state variables are used
- [ ] Ad components work correctly or are removed

### C2. Supabase Edge Function Contracts

Components call Supabase functions without clear contracts:

**Unclear Function Usage:**
- `ai-usage` function called in TeacherDashboard - contract undefined
- Edge function error handling inconsistent
- Response type validation missing

**Why This Matters:** Runtime errors when backend API changes or fails.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Document all Supabase Edge Function contracts
2. Add TypeScript types for function responses
3. Implement consistent error handling patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All Edge Functions have documented APIs
- [ ] TypeScript types defined for all function calls
- [ ] Consistent error handling across components

### C3. Feature Flag Implementation Gaps

`hasAdvancedAnalytics` boolean referenced but implementation unclear:

**Issues:**
- Boolean definition location unclear
- Gating logic inconsistent across components
- Subscription tier mapping undefined

**Why This Matters:** Analytics features may not gate properly, allowing unauthorized access.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Define clear subscription tier â†’ feature mapping
2. Implement consistent feature flag checking
3. Document all feature flags and their requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Clear documentation of all feature flags
- [ ] Consistent gating implementation across screens
- [ ] Subscription tier enforcement working correctly

---

## Priority 4 - Low Impact Issues (Polish & Completeness)

### D1. Financial Tools Validation

Financial management screens referenced but existence unconfirmed:

**Screens to Validate:**
- Financial dashboard implementation completeness
- Petty cash screen functionality
- Report generation capabilities
- Payment history features

**Why This Matters:** Users may expect financial features that don't exist.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Audit all financial screen implementations
2. Add proper empty states for unimplemented features
3. Document current financial feature status

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All financial screens exist or show "coming soon"
- [ ] Clear user communication about available vs planned features
- [ ] No broken financial workflows

### D2. Parent Messaging Implementation

Parent dashboard references `handleQuickMessage` function but implementation unclear:

**Issues:**
- Message initialization flow undefined
- Teacher contact mechanism unclear
- Message thread creation uncertain

**Why This Matters:** Parent-teacher communication may not work as expected.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Verify parent messaging workflow end-to-end
2. Ensure teacher contact information accessible
3. Test message thread creation and delivery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Parent can successfully message teachers
- [ ] Message threads work correctly
- [ ] Proper error handling for messaging failures

### D3. Platform-Specific Code Issues

Several utility functions need verification:

**To Verify:**
- `Feedback.vibrate()` - Platform handling and import
- WhatsApp fallback mechanisms
- Platform-specific UI adaptations

**Why This Matters:** Features may not work correctly across all supported platforms.

**Proposed Fix:**
1. Test all platform-specific features on target devices
2. Add proper fallbacks for unsupported platforms
3. Document platform limitations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All platform-specific features work correctly
- [ ] Proper fallbacks for unsupported functionality
- [ ] Clear documentation of platform differences

## Quick Wins (Easy Fixes)

### E1. Add Missing Screen Placeholders

**Effort:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Prevents navigation crashes

Create basic placeholder screens for all missing routes:
```typescript
export default function PlaceholderScreen({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Coming Soon</Text>
      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>{title} will be available in a future update.</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### E2. Standardize AI Enablement Logic  

**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Consistent AI feature behavior

Create shared utility:
```typescript
// lib/ai/enablement.ts
export function isAIEnabled(): boolean {
  return process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_ENABLED !== 'false' && 
         process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES !== 'false';
}
```

### E3. Add Critical Translation Keys

**Effort:** 3 hours  
**Impact:** Proper internationalization support

Add missing keys to `locales/en/common.json` and copy to other language files.
