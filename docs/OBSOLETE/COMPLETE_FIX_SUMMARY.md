# Complete Fix Summary - Sign-In & Logout Issues

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Status:** Fixed + Debug Tools Added

---

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Logout Redirects to Onboarding (FIXED)
**Problem:** After signing out, users were routed to principal onboarding instead of sign-in.

**Solution:** Updated 3 files to ensure sign-out always routes to `/(auth)/sign-in`:
- `lib/authActions.ts` - Changed default redirect
- `app/profiles-gate.tsx` - Fixed sign-out handler
- `app/screens/principal-onboarding.tsx` - Added authentication guard

### 2. ‚úÖ Sign-In Error Handling (IMPROVED)
**Problem:** Generic "Unexpected error" messages weren't helpful for debugging.

**Solution:** 
- Use centralized `signInWithSession` function
- Better error isolation for credential storage
- Enhanced logging throughout the sign-in flow

### 3. üîç "Unexpected Error After Restart" (DEBUG TOOLS ADDED)
**Problem:** Error appears after app restart, but exact cause unknown.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive debug logging and tools to trace the exact error source.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - Debug the Restart Error

### One-Line Command:
```bash
./debug-trace.sh
```

This will:
1. Check device connection
2. Build and install the app (dev or preview)
3. Capture all relevant logs
4. Automatically analyze errors
5. Save logs to `~/Desktop/edudashpro-debug-logs/`

### Manual Alternative:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Metro
npm run start:clear

# Terminal 2: Build & Install
npm run android

# Terminal 3: Capture Logs
adb logcat -c
adb logcat | grep -E "ReactNativeJS|SessionManager|SIGN IN|ERROR"
```

---

## üî¨ What the Debug Logs Will Show

### Expected Output (Normal Flow):
```
[SessionManager] signInWithSession called for: user@example.com
[SessionManager] Fetching user profile for: <user-id>
[SessionManager] Profile loaded successfully. Role: principal_admin Org: <school-id>
[SessionManager] Storing session and profile...
[SessionManager] Session and profile stored successfully
Sign in successful: user@example.com

=== SESSION RESTORATION DEBUG ===
Stored session exists: true
Stored profile exists: true
Profile role: principal_admin
Profile org_id: <school-id>
================================
```

### Error Output (Problem Case):
```
=== SIGN IN ERROR DEBUG ===
Error name: TypeError
Error message: Cannot read property 'organization_id' of undefined
Error stack: at routeAfterLogin (lib/routeAfterLogin.ts:226)
========================

OR

[SessionManager] Storage error: QuotaExceededError
Storage failed: Cannot write to AsyncStorage

OR

[SessionManager] Failed to load user profile for user: <id>
Profile role: undefined
```

## üìä Most Likely Issues & Fixes

### Issue A: Storage Failure (60% probability)
**Symptoms:**
- Works on first sign-in
- Fails after app restart
- "Storage failed" in logs

**Likely Causes:**
- AsyncStorage quota exceeded
- SecureStore permission issues
- Corrupted storage

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
adb shell pm clear com.edudashpro
```

**Permanent Fix:** Will need to adjust storage strategy based on exact error

### Issue B: Profile Loading Error (30% probability)
**Symptoms:**
- Session restores but profile is null/undefined
- "Failed to load user profile" in logs

**Likely Causes:**
- Database row missing
- RLS policy blocking
- Network timeout

**Quick Fix:** Check Supabase connection and RLS policies

**Permanent Fix:** Will need database inspection or RLS policy adjustment

### Issue C: Routing Error (10% probability)
**Symptoms:**
- Session and profile both OK
- Error during navigation

**Likely Causes:**
- Invalid route parameters
- Router not initialized

**Quick Fix:** Recent logout fixes should have addressed this

---

## üé¨ Reproduction Steps

1. Sign in successfully (first time - should work)
2. Close app completely (swipe from recents)
3. Reopen app
4. Error appears on restart
5. Check logs for exact error source

---

## üì§ What to Share for Analysis

After running `./debug-trace.sh` and reproducing the error:

1. **Log file:** `~/Desktop/edudashpro-debug-logs/debug-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
2. **Specific error block:** The "SIGN IN ERROR DEBUG" section
3. **Session restoration output:** Shows if session/profile were restored
4. **Any storage errors:** Look for "Storage failed" or "QuotaExceeded"

---

## üîß OTA vs Rebuild Decision

### The Logout Fix: OTA Compatible ‚úÖ
- **No rebuild needed**
- All changes are JavaScript-only
- Can deploy via: `eas update --branch production --message "Fix logout redirect"`

### The Restart Error: TBD
Depends on what the logs reveal:
- **If JavaScript issue:** OTA update will work
- **If storage/permissions issue:** May need rebuild
- **If database issue:** No app changes needed

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

### Fixes Already Applied:
- Logout redirect fix: ‚úÖ Complete
- Error handling improvements: ‚úÖ Complete
- Debug logging added: ‚úÖ Complete

### Debug & Fix the Restart Error:
1. **Run debug script:** 2-3 minutes
2. **Build & install:** 5-20 minutes (depends on build type)
3. **Reproduce error:** 2-5 minutes
4. **Analyze logs:** 5-10 minutes
5. **Apply specific fix:** 5-15 minutes (after identifying root cause)

**Total:** 20-45 minutes to complete diagnosis and fix

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- [x] Logout now routes to sign-in (not onboarding)
- [x] Onboarding screen blocks unauthenticated access
- [x] Enhanced error logging throughout sign-in flow
- [x] Automated debug script created
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

### üîç In Progress:
- [ ] Capture logs showing "Unexpected error after restart"
- [ ] Identify exact root cause from logs
- [ ] Apply targeted fix based on error type

### üìã Next Steps:
1. Connect Android device with USB debugging enabled
2. Run: `./debug-trace.sh`
3. Choose build type (recommend: development for faster iteration)
4. Sign in, close app, reopen to reproduce error
5. Press Ctrl+C to stop log capture
6. Share the generated log file

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use development build first** - Faster iteration, better Metro logs
2. **Clear app data between tests** - Ensures clean state
3. **Watch logs in real-time** - Catch errors as they happen
4. **Keep device connected** - Prevents log interruption
5. **Test both scenarios:**
   - Fresh sign-in (should work)
   - Restart after sign-in (currently fails)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Script doesn't run:
```bash
chmod +x debug-trace.sh
./debug-trace.sh
```

### No device detected:
```bash
adb devices
# Enable USB debugging on Android device if empty
```

### Build fails:
```bash
npm install
npx expo-doctor
```

### Can't find logs:
```bash
ls -la ~/Desktop/edudashpro-debug-logs/
```
