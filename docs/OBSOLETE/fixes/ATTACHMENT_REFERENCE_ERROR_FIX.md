# Fixed: Attachments ReferenceError ✅

## Error That Was Occurring
```
[Dash] Legacy AI service call failed: ReferenceError: attachments is not defined
at DashAIAssistant.callAIServiceLegacy (DashAIAssistant.ts:2389:33)
```

## Root Cause
The `generateResponse()` method received `attachments` parameter but didn't pass it to `callAIServiceLegacy()`. Then `callAIServiceLegacy()` tried to reference `attachments` variable that didn't exist in its scope.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added attachments to context object
**File:** `services/DashAIAssistant.ts` (line 2386)

```typescript
// Build context for AI
const context = {
  userInput,
  conversationHistory: recentMessages,
  userProfile: profile,
  memory: Array.from(this.memory.values()),
  personality: this.personality,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  attachments  // ✅ ADDED: Pass attachments through context
};
```

### 2. Used attachments from context
**File:** `services/DashAIAssistant.ts` (line 2518)

```typescript
// Before (caused error):
if (attachments && attachments.length > 0) {  // ❌ attachments not defined

// After (fixed):
const contextAttachments = context.attachments;
if (contextAttachments && contextAttachments.length > 0) {  // ✅ Gets from context
  const attachmentContext = await this.processAttachmentsForAI(contextAttachments);
  // ...
}
```

## What Works Now

✅ No more ReferenceError  
✅ Attachments properly passed through the chain:
  - `sendMessage(content, conversationId, attachments)`
  - → `generateResponse(userInput, conversationId, attachments)`  
  - → `context = { ...attachments }`
  - → `callAIServiceLegacy(context)`
  - → `const contextAttachments = context.attachments`
  - → `callAIService({ attachments: contextAttachments })`

✅ Dash can now see uploaded files  
✅ Image attachments sent to vision API  
✅ File context included in AI messages  

## Test It

1. Upload an image
2. Send message: "Can you see the image I sent?"
3. Should work without errors
4. Dash should respond acknowledging the file

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Error:** ReferenceError resolved
