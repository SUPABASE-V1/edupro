# Hybrid Onboarding Testing & Validation Guide

## üìã Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive hybrid onboarding strategy for EduDash Pro that supports three distinct flows:

### ‚úÖ **Completed Components**

1. **Database Schema Enhancements**
   - Enhanced `preschools` table with school_type, grade_levels, verification_status
   - Created `school_verifications` table for verification tracking
   - Added `onboarding_progress` table for flow management
   - Enhanced subscription plans with school type filtering

2. **Secure RPC Functions**
   - `register_new_school()` - Self-service school registration
   - `superadmin_onboard_school()` - Admin-managed school creation
   - `verify_school()` - School verification management  
   - `get_onboarding_status()` - Progress tracking

3. **User Interface Components**
   - School type selection screen with detailed options
   - Enhanced school registration with multi-step wizard
   - Updated subscription setup with school type filtering
   - Superadmin onboarding wizard for manual school creation
   - Enhanced existing principal onboarding flow

## üß™ Testing Guide

### **Flow 1: Self-Service School Registration**

#### Prerequisites
- Clean database state (or test environment)
- No existing user account for test emails

#### Test Steps
1. **School Type Selection**
   ```
   Navigation: /screens/school-type-selection
   ‚úì Verify all three school types are displayed (Preschool, K-12, Hybrid)
   ‚úì Verify detail views work for each type
   ‚úì Verify selection persistence
   ‚úì Verify navigation to school registration
   ```

2. **School Registration Wizard**
   ```
   Navigation: /screens/school-registration
   Step 1 - School Details:
   ‚úì School name validation
   ‚úì School type display matches selection
   ‚úì Grade level options change based on school type
   ‚úì Form validation and persistence
   
   Step 2 - Contact Information:
   ‚úì Email validation
   ‚úì Phone number validation
   ‚úì Optional address field
   
   Step 3 - Principal Information:
   ‚úì Principal name validation
   ‚úì Principal email validation (login email)
   ‚úì Registration summary display
   ‚úì Final registration submission
   ```

3. **Database Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Check school was created with correct data
   SELECT 
     name, 
     school_type, 
     grade_levels, 
     verification_status,
     onboarding_flow
   FROM preschools 
   WHERE name = 'Test School Name';
   
   -- Check verification record exists
   SELECT * FROM school_verifications 
   WHERE school_id = (SELECT id FROM preschools WHERE name = 'Test School Name');
   
   -- Check onboarding progress
   SELECT * FROM onboarding_progress 
   WHERE school_id = (SELECT id FROM preschools WHERE name = 'Test School Name');
   ```

#### Expected Results
- School record created with `onboarding_flow = 'self_service'`
- Verification record created with pending email verification
- Onboarding progress tracker initialized
- Audit log entry created

---

### **Flow 2: Superadmin-Managed School Creation**

#### Prerequisites
- Logged in as superadmin user
- Access to superadmin screens

#### Test Steps
1. **Superadmin Wizard Access**
   ```
   Navigation: /screens/super-admin/school-onboarding-wizard
   ‚úì Verify superadmin access control
   ‚úì Verify non-superadmin users are blocked
   ```

2. **School Creation Wizard**
   ```
   Step 1 - School Information:
   ‚úì School name validation
   ‚úì School type selection (Preschool/K-12/Hybrid)
   ‚úì Grade level selection based on type
   ‚úì Contact information fields
   ‚úì Admin notes field
   
   Step 2 - Principal Information:
   ‚úì Principal name validation
   ‚úì Principal email validation
   ‚úì Principal account setup information
   
   Step 3 - Subscription Setup:
   ‚úì Toggle subscription creation
   ‚úì Plan selection filtered by school type
   ‚úì Seat configuration
   ‚úì Auto-activate option
   
   Step 4 - Review & Create:
   ‚úì All information summary
   ‚úì Final creation process
   ‚úì Success confirmation with options
   ```

3. **Database Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Check school creation
   SELECT 
     name,
     school_type,
     grade_levels,
     verification_status,
     onboarding_flow
   FROM preschools 
   WHERE onboarding_flow = 'superadmin_invite';
   
   -- Check subscription if created
   SELECT * FROM subscriptions 
   WHERE school_id IN (
     SELECT id FROM preschools WHERE onboarding_flow = 'superadmin_invite'
   );
   ```

#### Expected Results
- School record with `verification_status = 'manual_override'`
- School record with `onboarding_flow = 'superadmin_invite'`
- Optional subscription record if configured
- Comprehensive audit log entry

---

### **Flow 3: Enhanced Principal Onboarding**

#### Prerequisites
- Logged in as principal user
- School not yet fully configured

#### Test Steps
1. **Type Selection Step**
   ```
   Navigation: /screens/principal-onboarding
   ‚úì Initial school type selection
   ‚úì Type persistence across steps
   ‚úì Appropriate messaging for each type
   ```

2. **Enhanced Onboarding Flow**
   ```
   Step 2 - School Details:
   ‚úì School information based on selected type
   ‚úì Type-specific labels and hints
   
   Step 3 - Teacher Invites:
   ‚úì Same functionality as before
   
   Step 4 - Templates:
   ‚úì Same functionality as before
   
   Step 5 - Subscription (if enabled):
   ‚úì Optional subscription selection
   ‚úì Plan recommendations
   
   Step 6 - Review:
   ‚úì Complete summary including school type
   ‚úì Final setup completion
   ```

#### Expected Results

### **Flow 4: Subscription Plan Filtering**

#### Test Steps
1. **Plan Filtering by School Type**
   ```
   Navigation: /screens/subscription-setup
   ‚úì Plans filtered based on school's type
   ‚úì Recommended plans highlighted
   ‚úì School type information displayed
   ‚úì Plan compatibility indicators
   ```

2. **Database Integration**
   ```sql
   -- Check subscription plans have school_types array
   SELECT name, tier, school_types FROM subscription_plans;
   ```

#### Expected Results
- Plans filtered appropriately for school type
- Recommended badges for optimal plans
- Clear school type context

## üîß Database Validation Queries

### Schema Verification
```sql
-- Verify preschools table enhancements
\d preschools;

-- Should include new columns:
-- school_type, grade_levels, verification_status, onboarding_completed_at, 
-- onboarding_flow, contact_email, contact_phone, physical_address, registration_notes

-- Verify new tables exist
\d school_verifications;
\d onboarding_progress;

-- Verify subscription_plans enhancement
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'subscription_plans' AND column_name = 'school_types';
```

### Data Integrity Checks
```sql
-- Check school type values
SELECT DISTINCT school_type FROM preschools;
-- Should return: preschool, k12_school, hybrid

-- Check onboarding flow values  
SELECT DISTINCT onboarding_flow FROM preschools;
-- Should return: self_service, superadmin_invite, migration, legacy

-- Check RLS policies are in place
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd, roles 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('school_verifications', 'onboarding_progress');
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Concurrent Registrations**
   - Test multiple schools registering simultaneously
   - Verify database performance under load
   - Check audit log performance

2. **Large Data Sets**
   - Test with schools having many grade levels
   - Test with complex subscription configurations
   - Verify query performance with filtering

### Monitoring Points
- RPC function execution time
- Database query performance
- UI responsiveness during multi-step flows
- Memory usage during form persistence

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation

### Access Control Testing
1. **RPC Function Security**
   ```sql
   -- Test unauthorized access to superadmin functions
   SELECT superadmin_onboard_school('{}', '{}', NULL);
   -- Should fail for non-superadmin users
   ```

2. **Row Level Security**
   ```sql
   -- Verify schools can only see their own verification records
   SELECT * FROM school_verifications; -- Should be filtered by RLS
   ```

3. **Input Validation**
   - Test SQL injection attempts in all form fields
   - Test XSS prevention in text fields
   - Verify email validation works correctly
