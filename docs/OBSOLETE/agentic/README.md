- [ ] Tests passing

### For Developers

**Start Here:**
1. Read [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)
2. Review [DASH_FULL_AGENTIC_ACTIVATION_PLAN.md](./DASH_FULL_AGENTIC_ACTIVATION_PLAN.md)
3. Check todo list: `read_todos` command
4. Begin Phase 1, Task 1.1

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Verify environment
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
supabase db diff  # Should show no pending changes

# Review governance rules
cat docs/governance/WARP.md
```

### For QA/Testing

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Autonomy boundaries**: Verify auto-exec policies
2. **Multi-tenant isolation**: Check preschool_id filtering
3. **High-risk approval**: Ensure confirmations shown
4. **Proactive relevance**: Validate suggestion quality
5. **Performance**: Monitor response times

**Test Suite:**
```bash
# Run agentic tests
npm run test:agentic

# Manual testing scenarios in QUICK_START.md
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Before (Current)
```
User → DashAIAssistant → AI Service → Response
         ↓
    DashContextAnalyzer (basic intent)
         ↓
    DashProactiveEngine (conservative suggestions)
```

### After (Target)
```
User → DashAIAssistant
         ↓
    DashContextAnalyzer (intent detection)
         ↓
    DashEduDashKnowledge (platform awareness)
         ↓
    DashCapabilityDiscovery (relevant features)
         ↓
    DashAutonomyManager (risk policy)
         ↓
    DashAgenticEngine (auto-exec or suggest)
         ↓
    Enhanced Response + Auto-executed Actions
         ↓
    DashTelemetry (learning & improvement)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- 🧠 **Knowledge-driven**: Every response EduDash-aware
- 🎛️ **Autonomy-controlled**: Safe auto-execution
- 🔍 **Discovery-powered**: Intelligent suggestions
- 📊 **Data-informed**: Telemetry for improvement

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Quantitative KPIs

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Proactive suggestion rate | >70% | agentic_events telemetry |
| Auto-exec success rate | >95% | agentic_decisions telemetry |
| Response time (simple) | <3s | Client timing |
| Response time (complex) | <8s | Client timing |
| Feature discovery | 5+ per user/week | agentic_suggestions telemetry |
| User satisfaction | >4.5/5 | Survey + thumbs feedback |

### Qualitative Goals

- ✅ Dash accurately describes any EduDash Pro feature
- ✅ Database queries respect tenant isolation (preschool_id)
- ✅ Navigation auto-opens in partner mode without friction
- ✅ High-risk actions always require approval
- ✅ Legacy code cleanly archived with documentation

## 🚨 Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Token bloat | Medium | Medium | Use bulleted summaries; limit to 8 features |
| Rate limiting | Low | High | Existing aiRequestQueue; cooldowns |
| Breaking changes | Medium | High | Gradual rollout; feature flags; testing |

### Safety Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized auto-exec | Low | High | Strict risk classification; telemetry monitoring |
| PII exposure | Low | Critical | No PII in telemetry; RLS enforcement |
| Multi-tenant breach | Very Low | Critical | Knowledge base emphasizes RLS; testing |

**Kill Switch:**
```bash
# Emergency disable
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_ENABLE=false
```
