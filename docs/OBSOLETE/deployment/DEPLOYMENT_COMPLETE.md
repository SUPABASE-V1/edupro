## üîç Database Verification Queries

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify policies:

```sql
-- Check petty_cash_transactions policies
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    policyname, 
    cmd, 
    roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'petty_cash_transactions';

-- Check petty_cash_accounts policies
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    policyname, 
    cmd, 
    roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'petty_cash_accounts';

-- Check students policies
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    policyname, 
    cmd, 
    roles
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'students';
