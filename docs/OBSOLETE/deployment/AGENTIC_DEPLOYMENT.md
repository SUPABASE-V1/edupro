# DASH Agentic System - Production Deployment Guide

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Production  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-13

---

## 🎯 System Overview

The DASH Agentic System transforms your AI assistant into an intelligent, context-aware, proactive agent capable of:
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Risk-aware execution with explainability
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Time and context-based interventions
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Sentiment analysis and mood tracking
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Context persistence across app restarts

---

## 📦 Deployment Components

### 1. Database Migrations ✅
```bash
# Already pushed to production
supabase/migrations/20251013081717_agent-telemetry-foundation.sql
supabase/migrations/20251013082423_agent-semantic-memory-schema.sql
```

**Tables Created:**
- `ai_events` - Event tracking (256 lines)
- `ai_feedback` - User feedback
- `ai_task_runs` - Execution history
- `ai_memories` - Semantic memory with vector search
- `ai_context_snapshots` - Context persistence
- `ai_insights` - AI-generated insights
- `ai_autonomy_settings` - User autonomy preferences

### 2. Core Services ✅

| Service | Lines | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `DashDecisionEngine.ts` | 526 | ✅ Production-ready |
| `DashProactiveEngine.ts` | 589 | ✅ Production-ready |
| `DashContextAnalyzer.ts` | 1,022 | ✅ Enhanced |
| `DashAgenticEngine.ts` | Enhanced | ✅ Integrated |
| **Total** | **2,137** | **✅ Complete** |

### 3. Feature Flags Required

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Core Agentic System
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_ENABLED=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_AUTONOMY=suggest  # none|suggest|confirm|autonomous
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_PREDICTIVE=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_SEMANTIC_MEMORY=true
```

**Autonomy Levels:**
- `none`: Passive observer only
- `suggest`: Show suggestions, require approval (RECOMMENDED for launch)
- `confirm`: Auto-execute low-risk, confirm medium-risk
- `autonomous`: Full autonomy (HIGH-RISK actions still require approval)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Database Schema
```bash
# Check migrations applied
supabase db diff

# Should return: No schema changes detected
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy example env
cp .env.example .env

# Set agentic flags
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_ENABLED=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_AUTONOMY=suggest
```

### Step 3: TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npm run typecheck

# Expected: Only dependency warnings (React Navigation, etc.)
# No errors in our code
```

### Step 4: Test Agentic System (Optional)
```bash
# Run integration tests
npx ts-node scripts/test-agentic-engines.ts

# Expected output:
# ✅ Decision Engine: Working
# ✅ Proactive Engine: Working  
# ✅ Context Analyzer: Working
# ✅ Integration Flow: Working
```

### Step 5: Build & Deploy
```bash
# Development build
npm run dev:android

# Production build
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Row-Level Security (RLS) ✅
- [x] All `ai_*` tables have RLS enabled
- [x] Tenant isolation via `preschool_id`
- [x] User-owned data restricted by `user_id`
- [x] Service role never exposed to client

### Data Privacy ✅
- [x] Context snapshots throttled (30s intervals)
- [x] Memory items have expiration policies
- [x] No PII in decision logs
- [x] User can view/delete their data

### Feature Flags ✅
- [x] Agentic features behind flags
- [x] Graceful degradation if disabled
- [x] User can adjust autonomy level

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Decision Engine**
   ```typescript
   const stats = DashDecisionEngine.getDecisionStats();
   // - Total decisions
   // - Avg confidence
   // - Risk distribution
   // - Execution strategies
   ```

2. **Proactive Engine**
   ```typescript
   const stats = DashProactiveEngine.getStats();
   // - Total rules
   // - Active rules
   // - Triggered today
   // - Dismissed today
   ```

3. **Database Telemetry**
   ```sql
   -- Decision metrics
   SELECT 
     event_type, 
     COUNT(*) as count,
     AVG((event_data->>'confidence')::float) as avg_confidence
   FROM ai_events
   WHERE event_type LIKE 'ai.agent.%'
   GROUP BY event_type;
   
   -- Proactive acceptance rate
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'ai.agent.proactive_offer_accepted') * 100.0 / 
     NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'ai.agent.proactive_offer_shown'), 0) as acceptance_rate
   FROM ai_events;
   ```

### Alerts to Configure

- Decision confidence drops below 60%
- High-risk decisions spike above baseline
- Proactive suggestion acceptance rate < 20%
- Context snapshot failures
- Memory table growth exceeds threshold

---

## 🎛️ Runtime Configuration

### User Autonomy Settings

Allow users to configure their experience:

```typescript
interface AutonomySettings {
  level: 'none' | 'suggest' | 'confirm' | 'autonomous';
  max_risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  quiet_hours: { start: number; end: number }; // Hours 0-23
  proactive_reminders: boolean;
  emotional_tracking: boolean;
}
```

Store in `ai_autonomy_settings` table (already created).

### Default Settings by Role

| Role | Default Autonomy | Max Risk | Proactive |
|------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| Teacher | `confirm` | `medium` | ✅ Yes |
| Principal | `confirm` | `high` | ✅ Yes |
| Parent | `suggest` | `low` | ✅ Yes |
| Student | `suggest` | `low` | ✅ Limited |

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### 1. Decision Engine
- Low-risk task (auto-execute in `confirm` mode)
- Medium-risk task (request approval)
- High-risk task (always require approval)

### 2. Proactive Engine
- Morning planning (7 AM teacher)
- Homework check (6 PM parent)
- Study break (after 45min student)
- Weekly wrap-up (Friday 3 PM)

### 3. Context Analyzer
- Emotional detection (frustrated user)
- Urgency detection ("urgent", "asap")
- Intent recognition (lesson planning, grading)
- Context persistence (cross-session)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Proactive suggestions not appearing
**Check:**
1. Feature flag: `EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_ENABLED=true`
2. Autonomy level: Not set to `none`
3. Time matches rule triggers (check hour/day)
4. Cooldown period not active
5. Daily occurrence limit not reached

### Issue: Decisions always require approval
**Check:**
1. Autonomy level (must be `confirm` or `autonomous` for auto-execution)
2. Risk level vs autonomy matrix
3. Decision confidence above threshold (0.4)
4. Feasibility score above threshold (0.5)

### Issue: Context not persisting
**Check:**
1. Database permissions (RLS policies)
2. Snapshot throttle interval (30s default)
3. Feature flag: `EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_SEMANTIC_MEMORY=true`
4. User profile loaded successfully

## 📈 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Decision latency | < 150ms | < 300ms |
| Proactive check | < 100ms | < 200ms |
| Context analysis | < 200ms | < 400ms |
| Memory query | < 50ms | < 100ms |

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:

### Level 1: Feature Flag Disable
```bash
# Disable agentic system instantly
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_ENABLED=false

# Push update via OTA
eas update --branch production
```

### Level 2: Autonomy Downgrade
```bash
# Reduce to suggestion-only mode
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTIC_AUTONOMY=suggest
```

### Level 3: Database Rollback
```bash
# Revert migrations (LAST RESORT)
supabase db reset
# Then restore from backup
```
