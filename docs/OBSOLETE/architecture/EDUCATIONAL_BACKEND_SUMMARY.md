- ✅ **MIME Type Restrictions**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- ✅ **Size Limitations**: Appropriate limits per bucket type

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Migration
- [ ] Backup existing database
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection and permissions
- [ ] Check existing RBAC system compatibility

### Migration Steps
1. [ ] Run migrations in numerical order (000100 through 000800)
2. [ ] Verify tables created with: `scripts/verify-educational-migrations.sql`
3. [ ] Test storage buckets and policies
4. [ ] Run integration tests
5. [ ] Verify RBAC permissions work correctly

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All tables exist with proper constraints
- [ ] All functions are callable and return expected results
- [ ] Storage buckets have correct policies
- [ ] RLS policies properly restrict access
- [ ] Triggers are working (timestamp updates, gradebook updates)
