# AI Quota Allocation System - AI-FLOW.md

## üéØ Overview

The EduDash Pro AI Quota Allocation System is a comprehensive framework that manages AI usage quotas, billing, and resource distribution across different user types and subscription tiers. This system complies with WARP.md's Golden Rule by empowering principals to efficiently distribute AI resources among their staff while maintaining strict security and cost controls.

---

## üìã Key Components

### 1. **AI Services & Features**

The system manages quotas for three primary AI services:

| Service Type | Description | Typical Usage |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| `lesson_generation` | AI-powered lesson content creation | Teachers generating custom lessons |
| `grading_assistance` | Automated assessment and feedback | Teachers getting grading suggestions |
| `homework_help` | Student homework assistance | Parents/students getting learning support |

### 2. **Organization Types & Tiers**

Users are classified by organization type and subscription tier:

#### Organization Types
- **Preschool** ‚Äî Early childhood education providers (allocation available with Pro+)
- **K-12** ‚Äî Schools covering kindergarten through 12th grade (allocation available with Enterprise only)
- **Individual** ‚Äî Teachers or parents not affiliated with a managed school (direct personal quotas)

#### Subscription Tiers & Default Monthly Quotas
```typescript
const DEFAULT_MONTHLY_QUOTAS = {
  free: { 
    lesson_generation: 5, 
    grading_assistance: 5, 
    homework_help: 15 
  },
  parent_starter: { 
    lesson_generation: 0, 
    grading_assistance: 0, 
    homework_help: 30 
  },
  parent_plus: { 
    lesson_generation: 0, 
    grading_assistance: 0, 
    homework_help: 100 
  },
  private_teacher: { 
    lesson_generation: 20, 
    grading_assistance: 20, 
    homework_help: 100 
  },
  pro: { 
    lesson_generation: 50, 
    grading_assistance: 100, 
    homework_help: 300 
  },
  enterprise: { 
    lesson_generation: 5000, 
    grading_assistance: 10000, 
    homework_help: 30000 
  }
}
```

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

```sql
-- Teachers/Parents: Can only view their own usage
CREATE POLICY "ai_usage_logs_user_select" ON ai_usage_logs
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id::uuid);

-- Principals: Can view school-wide usage 
CREATE POLICY "ai_usage_logs_principal_select" ON ai_usage_logs
    FOR SELECT USING (preschool_id = current_user_preschool_id());

-- Superadmins: Must use service functions (no direct table access)
```

### AI Integration Security (WARP.md Compliant)
- **Server-Side Only**: All AI calls via `ai-proxy` Edge Function
- **No Client Keys**: Zero client-side AI API keys (`EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not used)
- **Usage Tracking**: All AI requests logged to `ai_usage_logs` server-side
- **Quota Enforcement**: Server validates limits before processing requests
- **PII Protection**: Data sanitized before sending to AI services

## üí∞ Pricing & Billing Model

### Rate Limits & Charges

#### Monthly Subscription Costs
Based on pricing data from the codebase:

| Tier | Monthly Cost | Features | AI Quotas |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Free | R0 | Basic dashboard, limited AI | 5/5/15 quotas |
| Starter | ~R149+ | Enhanced features | Higher quotas |
| Pro | ~R299+ | School allocation features | 50/100/300 quotas |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited features | 5000/10000/30000 quotas |

#### Overage Policy
```typescript
type EffectiveLimits = {
  overageRequiresPrepay: boolean // Default: true
  // If true: Usage blocked when quota exceeded
  // If false: Allow overages with additional billing
}
```

#### Model Selection & Costs
- **Free/Starter**: Claude (standard model only)
- **Pro/Enterprise**: Model selection available (Claude, OpenAI, Custom providers)
- **Relative Costs**: Factored into usage tracking and billing

#### AI Usage Tracking & Costs
```typescript
interface AIUsageLog {
  input_tokens: number
  output_tokens: number
  input_cost: number    // Cost for input tokens
  output_cost: number   // Cost for output tokens  
  total_cost: number    // Combined cost
  model_provider: 'claude' | 'openai' | 'custom'
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è Quota Allocation System

### How Allocation Works

#### 1. **School Subscription Setup**
```typescript
interface SchoolAISubscription {
  total_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>      // Purchased quotas
  allocated_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>  // Allocated to teachers
  available_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>  // Available for allocation
  allow_teacher_self_allocation: boolean            // Self-service enabled
  default_teacher_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>
}
```

#### 2. **Teacher Allocation Process**
```typescript
interface TeacherAIAllocation {
  allocated_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>  // Teacher's allocation
  used_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>       // Used this period
  remaining_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>  // Available to use
  priority_level: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high'        // For quota rebalancing
  auto_renew: boolean                               // Auto-allocate next cycle
}
```

### 3. **Usage Enforcement Flow**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Request] --> B[Check User Tier]
    B --> C[Get Effective Limits]
    C --> D{Org Allocation?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Check Teacher Allocation]
    D -->|No| F[Check Default Tier Quota]
    E --> G{Quota Available?}
    F --> G
    G -->|Yes| H[Process Request]
    G -->|No| I[Block & Show Upgrade]
    H --> J[Log Usage]
    J --> K[Update Quotas]
```

  top_users: Array<{                              // Highest usage teachers
    user_name: string
    total_usage: number
    breakdown: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>
  }>
  peak_usage_day: string                          // Busiest day
}
```

#### Optimization Suggestions
```typescript
interface OptimalAllocationSuggestions {
  suggestions: Array<{
    teacher_id: string
    current_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>
    suggested_quotas: Record<AIQuotaFeature, number>
    reasoning: string                             // AI-generated reasoning
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
    potential_savings: number                     // Cost savings estimate
  }>
  school_summary: {
    total_quota_utilization: number              // % of quotas used
    underused_quotas: number                     // Wasted allocations
    overdemand_teachers: number                  // Teachers needing more
    optimization_potential: number              // % improvement possible
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Daily Rollup Data
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ai_usage_daily AS
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as usage_date,
    preschool_id,
    service_type,
    COUNT(*) as request_count,
    SUM(total_cost) as total_cost,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'quota_exceeded' THEN 1 END) as quota_exceeded_count
FROM ai_usage_logs
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), preschool_id, service_type;
```
