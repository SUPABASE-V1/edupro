## ‚úÖ Solution (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Supabase project dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and paste this migration:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/20251008060100_fix_voice_notes_storage_rls.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents
   - Paste into the SQL Editor

4. **Run the migration**
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for success message

5. **Verify it worked:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this query to check:
   SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
   AND policyname LIKE '%voice%';
   ```
   
   You should see 4 policies:
   - Users can upload their own voice notes
   - Users can read their own voice notes
   - Users can update their own voice notes
   - Users can delete their own voice notes

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI

cd /home/king/Desktop/edudashpro

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Still getting RLS errors?

**Check 1: Bucket exists**
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'voice-notes';
```
Should return 1 row.

**Check 2: Policies are active**
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
  AND schemaname = 'storage'
  AND policyname LIKE '%voice%';
```
Should return 4 rows (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).

**Check 3: User is authenticated**
```sql
SELECT auth.uid();
```
Should return your user ID (not null).

### If something went wrong:

1. **Drop and recreate policies:**
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own voice notes" ON storage.objects;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read their own voice notes" ON storage.objects;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own voice notes" ON storage.objects;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own voice notes" ON storage.objects;
   ```

2. **Re-run the migration**
