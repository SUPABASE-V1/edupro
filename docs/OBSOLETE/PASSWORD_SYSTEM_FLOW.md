# Password Policy System in EduDashPro

## How It Works for Users

### üîê Registration Flow
1. User goes to registration screen
2. Selects role (Principal/Teacher/Parent/Student)
3. Fills out personal info
4. **Password Field Interaction:**
   - User starts typing password
   - Real-time strength indicator appears below field
   - Color-coded bar shows strength: Red (Weak) ‚Üí Orange (Fair) ‚Üí Yellow (Good) ‚Üí Green (Strong/Excellent)
   - Checklist shows requirements being met in real-time:
     ‚úì At least 8 characters
     ‚úì Uppercase letter (A-Z)
     ‚úì Lowercase letter (a-z)
     ‚úì Number (0-9)
     ‚úì Special character (!@#$%...)
     ‚úì Not a common password
     ‚úì No personal information

5. Form validates password on submission
6. If password is too weak, registration is blocked with specific error messages

### üîÑ Password Recovery Flow
1. User forgets password and clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enters email and gets recovery link
3. **New Password Setup:**
   - Same real-time validation as registration
   - Must meet all policy requirements
   - Cannot reuse old password
   - Shows strength feedback instantly

### ‚öôÔ∏è Profile Management
1. User wants to change password in settings
2. **Password Change Form:**
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password with real-time validation
   - Confirm new password
   - All policy rules apply
