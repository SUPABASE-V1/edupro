# Premium Feature Upgrade Banners & Navigation Fixes

This document summarizes the implementation of premium feature upgrade banners and navigation improvements made to the EduDash Pro application.

## Overview

The task involved:
1. **Premium Feature Gating**: Add proper upgrade banners for premium-only features in Quick Actions
2. **Navigation Fixes**: Fix back button behavior on pages without proper back button support
3. **Code Consistency**: Fix remaining `useProfile` errors by migrating to `useAuth()` consistently

## Changes Made

### 1. Premium Feature Banner Components

#### A. `PremiumFeatureBanner.tsx` (New)
- **Location**: `/components/ui/PremiumFeatureBanner.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive premium feature blocking and upgrade component
- **Features**:
  - Two variants: `fullscreen` (blocking) and `inline` (non-blocking)
  - Analytics tracking for upgrade clicks
  - Themed styling with consistent branding
  - Built-in back button for fullscreen variant
  - Accessibility support

#### B. `InlineUpgradeBanner.tsx` (New) 
- **Location**: `/components/ui/InlineUpgradeBanner.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Inline upgrade prompts for partial premium features
- **Features**:
  - Three variants: `default`, `compact`, and `minimal`
  - Non-blocking UI that doesn't interfere with core functionality
  - Analytics integration
  - Conditional rendering (hides for premium users)

#### C. Premium Feature Modal Screen
- **Location**: `/app/premium-feature-modal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Full-screen modal for premium feature access
- **Features**:
  - Uses URL parameters to customize content
  - Integrates with `PremiumFeatureBanner` component

### 2. Enhanced Quick Actions with Premium Gating

#### Updated `EnhancedQuickActions.tsx`
- **Location**: `/components/dashboard/EnhancedQuickActions.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added premium gating logic with subscription tier checking
  - Premium features now show "Premium" badge overlay
  - Clicking premium features navigates to upgrade modal instead of blocking
  - Added premium features:
    - **WhatsApp Connect**: Premium-gated communication feature
    - **Learning Resources**: Premium study materials access
    - **Progress Analytics**: Advanced performance tracking
  - Enhanced visual indicators for premium features

### 3. Navigation Improvements

#### Updated Navigation Logic
- **Location**: `/lib/navigation.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `shouldAlwaysShowBackButton()` helper function
  - Enhanced route detection for modal screens, detail screens, settings, etc.
  - Improved `shouldShowBackButton()` to prioritize essential back button contexts
  - Better handling of premium feature modal navigation

#### Key Navigation Rules Added:
```typescript
// Always show back button for these route types:
- Modal screens (contains 'modal', '-modal', 'premium-feature')
- Detail screens (contains 'detail', '-detail')
- Settings screens (contains 'settings', 'config', 'preferences')
- Account screens (contains 'account', 'profile', 'subscription')
```

### 4. Code Consistency Fixes

#### Fixed `useProfile` Migration Issues
- **Location**: `/lib/ai/hooks/useAIAllocation.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced remaining `useProfile()` calls with `useAuth()`
  - Updated `useAllocateAIQuotas()` to use `getAllocationScope()` helper
  - Updated `useRequestAIQuotas()` to use proper scope derivation
  - Updated `useBulkAllocateQuotas()` for consistency
  - Fixed all profile property access patterns

## Implementation Details

### Premium Feature Detection Logic

```typescript
// Check if feature is premium-gated and user doesn't have premium
const isPremiumBlocked = isPremium && tier !== 'premium'

const handlePress = () => {
  if (isPremiumBlocked) {
    // Navigate to premium feature banner screen
    router.push({
      pathname: '/premium-feature-modal',
      params: {
        featureName: title,
        description: premiumDescription || description,
        screen: 'quick-actions',
        icon: icon,
      },
    })
    return
  }
  onPress()
}
```

### Analytics Integration

All premium feature interactions are tracked:
- `premium.upgrade_clicked` - When user clicks upgrade buttons
- `premium.banner_closed` - When user closes premium banners
- Feature-specific tracking with screen context

### Styling Approach

- **Consistent Theming**: All components use `useTheme()` for consistent styling
- **Responsive Design**: Components adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and touch targets
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear premium indicators without being intrusive

## Usage Examples

### Using PremiumFeatureBanner in Screens

```typescript
// Fullscreen blocking banner
<PremiumFeatureBanner 
  featureName="AI Lesson Generator" 
  description="Generate personalized lessons with AI assistance"
  screen="ai-lesson-generator"
  variant="fullscreen"
  onClose={() => router.back()}
/>

// Inline banner
<PremiumFeatureBanner 
  featureName="Advanced Analytics" 
  description="Get detailed insights into student performance"
  screen="analytics"
  variant="inline"
/>
```

### Using InlineUpgradeBanner

```typescript
// Default upgrade banner
<InlineUpgradeBanner 
  title="Unlock Premium Analytics" 
  description="Get detailed insights and advanced reporting features"
  screen="analytics"
  feature="advanced_analytics"
  variant="default"
/>

// Compact version for limited space
<InlineUpgradeBanner 
  screen="quick-actions"
  feature="whatsapp_connect"
  variant="compact"
/>
```

## Configuration

### Subscription Tier Rules
- **Free Tier**: Basic features only, shows upgrade prompts
- **Starter Plan**: Some premium features unlocked  
- **Premium Plan**: All features unlocked, no upgrade banners shown

### Feature Flags
Premium features can be controlled via:
- Component-level `isPremium` prop
- Subscription context tier checking
- Feature-specific visibility rules

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Non-intrusive premium feature promotion
2. **Conversion**: Clear upgrade paths with proper context
3. **Consistency**: Unified premium feature handling across the app
4. **Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of premium feature engagement
5. **Accessibility**: Proper screen reader support and navigation
6. **Maintainability**: Reusable components with clear APIs

## Technical Notes

- All components are properly typed with TypeScript
- Components follow React Native best practices
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Efficient re-rendering with proper React hooks usage
- Theme-aware styling for light/dark mode support

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. A/B testing for different upgrade prompt styles
2. Personalized upgrade recommendations based on usage patterns
3. Time-limited trial access to premium features
4. Progressive feature unlocking based on engagement
5. Integration with external payment processing for direct upgrades
