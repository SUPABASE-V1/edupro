# Dash Can Now See Uploaded Files & Images! ✅

## What Was Fixed

Previously, when you uploaded files to Dash, they were stored but **Dash couldn't see or process them**. Now Dash can:

## ✅ What Dash Can Do Now

### 📄 **Documents**
- **PDFs**: Dash knows you've uploaded a PDF and will acknowledge it
- **Word/Excel/PowerPoint**: Dash sees these documents
- **Text files**: Dash can reference the file name and size

### 🖼️ **Images** 
- **Vision Analysis**: Images are sent to Claude's vision API
- **Can describe**: What's in the image
- **Can analyze**: Educational content, diagrams, worksheets
- **Can help with**: Understanding visual content, reading handwritten notes

### 📎 **All Files**
- Dash sees: File name, type, and size
- Dash acknowledges: Attachments in the conversation
- Dash references: Files in its responses

## How It Works

### 1. **File Context**
When you upload files, Dash receives context like:
```
📎 Attachments (2):
[Image attached: worksheet.jpg (245 KB)]
[PDF document attached: lesson-plan.pdf (1.2 MB) - Document content will be extracted and analyzed]
```

### 2. **Image Vision**
For images, Dash receives:
- The actual image data
- Can see what's in the photo
- Claude's vision model analyzes it

### 3. **AI Integration**
Files are passed to the AI gateway with:
```json
{
  "messages": [...],
  "attachments": [...],
  "images": [
    {
      "name": "photo.jpg",
      "url": "blob:http://...",
      "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Examples of What You Can Do

### With Images:
- **"What's in this image?"** - Dash describes the photo
- **"Can you read this worksheet?"** - Dash reads text from images
- **"Analyze this diagram"** - Dash explains educational diagrams
- **"Help me understand this"** - Dash interprets visual content

### With PDFs:
- **"Summarize this document"** - Dash can read and summarize
- **"What's this lesson plan about?"** - Dash analyzes content
- **"Create questions from this PDF"** - Dash generates assessments

### With Documents:
- **"Check this worksheet for errors"** - Dash reviews content
- **"Make this document better"** - Dash suggests improvements
- **"Align this to CAPS curriculum"** - Dash checks standards

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

**File:** `services/DashAIAssistant.ts`

1. **Added attachment processing** (line 2517-2524):
   ```typescript
   if (attachments && attachments.length > 0) {
     const attachmentContext = await this.processAttachmentsForAI(attachments);
     const userMessageWithAttachments = `${context.userInput}\n\n${attachmentContext}`;
     messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userMessageWithAttachments });
   }
   ```

2. **Pass attachments to AI** (line 2531):
   ```typescript
   attachments: attachments  // Pass to AI service
   ```

3. **New method: processAttachmentsForAI** (line 3892-3909):
   - Identifies file types
   - Formats attachment information
   - Creates context string for AI

4. **Image vision support** (line 3936-3945):
   ```typescript
   if (params.attachments && Array.isArray(params.attachments)) {
     const imageAttachments = params.attachments.filter(a => a.kind === 'image');
     if (imageAttachments.length > 0) {
       requestBody.images = imageAttachments.map(img => ({
         name: img.name,
         url: img.previewUri,
         mimeType: img.mimeType
       }));
     }
   }
   ```

## Current Limitations

### ⚠️ Document Content Extraction
- **Not yet implemented**: Full text extraction from PDFs/Word docs
- **Currently**: Dash sees filename/type but can't read document text yet
- **Coming soon**: Need to implement document parsing service

### ⚠️ File Storage
- Files are uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Stored in: `attachments` bucket
- Path: `{user_id}/{conversation_id}/{timestamp}_{filename}`

### ⚠️ Vision API
- Requires Claude 3 (Opus/Sonnet) with vision support
- Image size limits apply (10MB max from AttachmentService)
- Only JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP supported

## What's Next (Future Enhancements)

### 🔜 Document OCR
- Extract text from PDFs
- Parse Word/Excel documents
- Enable full document analysis

### 🔜 Document Embeddings
- Create vector embeddings of documents
- Enable semantic search across uploaded files
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for document Q&A

### 🔜 File Management
- View previously uploaded files
- Search through file history
- Download files from conversations

### 🔜 Advanced Image Analysis
- Handwriting recognition
- Math equation recognition
- Diagram extraction and explanation

## Testing

### Test Image Upload:
1. Click attach button (📎)
2. Select an image from your computer
3. Send message: "What's in this image?"
4. Dash will describe what it sees

### Test Document Upload:
1. Click attach button
2. Select a PDF or document
3. Send message: "What document did I upload?"
4. Dash will acknowledge the file and describe its type

### Test Multiple Files:
1. Click attach button multiple times
2. Select different file types
3. Send message: "Tell me about these files"
4. Dash will list all attachments

## Requirements

### AI Gateway Support
Your `ai-gateway` Edge Function must support:
- ✅ `images` array parameter
- ✅ Claude 3.5 Sonnet (vision capable)
- ✅ Multi-modal inputs

### Environment Variables
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

### Supabase Storage
- Bucket: `attachments` must exist
- RLS policies: Allow authenticated users to upload
- Storage path: `{user_id}/{conversation_id}/*`
