# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Avatar Storage Setup Required

## Problem Identified

The Supabase `avatars` storage bucket **does not exist**, which is why you're seeing local file URI errors like:

```
Not allowed to load local resource: file:///data/user/0/com.edudashpro/cache/ImageManipulator/29880b8e-7677-43e4-ba1a-effc5c903cce.jpg
```

When the upload to Supabase fails (because the bucket doesn't exist), the app falls back to trying to display local processed image URIs, which browsers don't allow for security reasons.

## Quick Fix: Create the Avatars Bucket

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `edudashpro`

2. **Navigate to Storage:**
   - Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create a new bucket"

3. **Create the avatars bucket:**
   ```
   Bucket Name: avatars
   Public bucket: âœ… Yes (checked)
   File size limit: 5242880 (5MB)
   Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp,image/avif
   ```

4. **Click "Create bucket"**

### Option 2: Via SQL Editor

1. **Go to SQL Editor:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql

2. **Run this SQL:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
   VALUES (
     'avatars',
     'avatars', 
     true,
     5242880, -- 5MB limit
     ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/avif']
   ) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
   ```

### Option 3: Complete Migration (Advanced)

Run the complete SQL migration from `migrations/20250917_setup_avatars_storage.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor. This includes:
- âœ… Bucket creation
- âœ… RLS policies for secure access
- âœ… Helper functions
- âœ… Automatic cleanup triggers

## Verify the Fix

After creating the bucket, run this to verify:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-avatar-storage.ts
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Buckets found: avatars
âœ… Avatars bucket exists
âœ… Can access avatars bucket
âœ… Can generate public URLs
```

## Expected Result

Once the bucket is created:

1. **Profile image uploads will work** - images will be stored in Supabase Storage
2. **Public URLs will be generated** - like `https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/avatars/profile_user-id_timestamp.jpg`
3. **No more local URI errors** - because images will use proper HTTP URLs
4. **Images will display on all platforms** - including web browsers

## Why This Happened

The `avatars` bucket was never created during the initial setup. The ProfileImageService code is correctly configured to use Supabase Storage, but it can't upload without the bucket existing first.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Create the `avatars` bucket (using Option 1 above)
2. âœ… Test profile image upload in the app
3. âœ… Verify images display properly on web and mobile
4. âœ… Check that old local URIs are replaced with Supabase URLs

This should completely resolve the "Not allowed to load local resource" error!
