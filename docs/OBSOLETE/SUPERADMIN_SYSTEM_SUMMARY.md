- **UI References**: "Super Admin" or "superadmin"
- **File Names**: `super-admin-*.tsx` (kebab-case with hyphens)

### Security Model
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all critical tables
- **Function Security**: All RPC functions validate superadmin permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All administrative actions are logged
- **Access Control**: Strict role-based access throughout

### Database Functions Summary
| Function | Purpose | Parameters |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `is_superadmin()` | Check current user permissions | None |
| `get_superadmin_dashboard_data()` | Fetch platform statistics | None |
| `test_superadmin_system()` | System health check | None |
| `superadmin_suspend_user()` | Suspend user account | `target_user_id`, `reason` |
| `superadmin_reactivate_user()` | Reactivate suspended user | `target_user_id`, `reason` |
| `superadmin_update_user_role()` | Change user role | `target_user_id`, `new_role`, `reason` |
| `superadmin_request_user_deletion()` | Request user deletion | `target_user_id`, `deletion_type`, `reason` |
