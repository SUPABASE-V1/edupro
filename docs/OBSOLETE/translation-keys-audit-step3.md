## Recommendations for Future Implementations

When adding new UI features in the future, consider:

1. **Namespace consistency**: Continue using the established namespaces (`dashboard.*`, `settings.*`, `common.*`, etc.)
2. **Descriptive keys**: Use clear, descriptive key names that indicate their purpose
3. **Reusability**: Check for existing keys before creating new ones to avoid duplication
4. **Documentation**: Update this audit document when adding significant new features

*This audit ensures that the UI integration is complete and properly localized for English users. Additional language support can be added by translating these existing keys to other locales.*
