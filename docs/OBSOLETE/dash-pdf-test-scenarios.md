## Troubleshooting

### Issue: PDF Button Not Appearing
**Possible Causes:**
- AI didn't generate enough content (less than 200 chars)
- Content doesn't match expected patterns (no numbered items)
- Request keywords not recognized (test, worksheet, practice, etc.)

**Solution:**
- Be more specific in request
- Use keywords like "test", "worksheet", "practice"
- Ask for specific number of questions

### Issue: PDF Export Fails
**Possible Causes:**
- Browser/device permissions not granted
- Storage access denied
- PDF service not initialized

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify device storage permissions
- Restart the app and try again

### Issue: Content Not Age-Appropriate
**Possible Causes:**
- AI misunderstood age group
- Request wasn't specific enough

**Solution:**
- Specify age/grade level explicitly
- Use terms like "preschool", "5-year-olds", "grade 1"
- Provide more context in the request
