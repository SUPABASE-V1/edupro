## üî• **CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0)**

### 1. TypeScript Regression Crisis
- **Status**: 111 errors across 25 files
- **Impact**: Development velocity severely impacted, deployment risk
- **Root Causes**:
  - Router typing issues (`router.push` params)
  - Supabase query result typing (`preschool_id` undefined access)
  - Environment variable access without validation
  - Missing i18n keys and hard-coded strings
- **Solution**: 2-wave fix plan (fast wins ‚Üí comprehensive typing)

### 2. Offline-First Missing
- **Status**: No TanStack Query persistence or offline queue found
- **Impact**: Unusable in 60%+ of SA schools with unreliable internet
- **Gap**: Core competitive differentiator missing
- **Solution**: Query persistence + offline mutation queue implementation

### 3. Localization Gaps
- **Status**: isiZulu completely missing, several i18n keys missing in en/af
- **Impact**: Cannot serve majority of SA teachers/students in native language
- **Solution**: Add isiZulu baseline + fill missing keys + i18n audit script

---

## ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION-READY COMPONENTS**

### AI-Powered Teaching Tools
- **Lesson Generator**: Full end-to-end functionality with usage quotas
- **Homework Grader**: Streaming AI responses with teacher oversight
- **Homework Helper**: Child-safe, step-by-step guidance (not answers)
- **Usage Tracking**: Client/server hybrid with fallbacks
- **Feature Gating**: Plan-based access control working

### Financial Management System  
- **Petty Cash System**: SA currency denominations, receipt uploads
- **Financial Reports**: Revenue, expenses, cash flow with real data
- **Transaction History**: Tenant-scoped queries with RLS
