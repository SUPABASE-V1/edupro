# School Settings Integration - Step 3 Complete

**Date**: January 2025  
**Feature**: Centralized School Settings Backend Integration  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

The Enhanced Principal Dashboard has been successfully wired to use the centralized school settings backend via the `useSchoolSettings` hook. This integration ensures that all school configuration (WhatsApp, features, regional settings) flows from a single source of truth in the database.

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced Principal Dashboard Integration

**File**: `components/dashboard/EnhancedPrincipalDashboard.tsx`

#### Key Changes:

✅ **School Settings Hook Integration** (Line 75-76)
```typescript
const schoolSettingsQuery = useSchoolSettings((profile as any)?.organization_id);
const { refetch: refetchSchoolSettings } = schoolSettingsQuery;
```

✅ **Real-time Settings Consumption** (Lines 79-85)
```typescript
const schoolSettings = schoolSettingsQuery.data;
const isWAConfigured = !!schoolSettings?.whatsapp_number;
const isWAEnabled = isWhatsAppEnabled() || isWAConfigured;

// Derived state from centralized settings
const financialsEnabled = schoolSettings?.features?.financialReports?.enabled ?? true;
const pettyCashEnabled = schoolSettings?.features?.pettyCash?.enabled ?? true;
```

✅ **Auto-refresh on Dashboard Focus** (Lines 109-119)
```typescript
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    if (hasRefreshedOnFocus.current) {
      refresh();
      // Also refresh school settings to ensure latest config
      refetchSchoolSettings?.();
    } else {
      hasRefreshedOnFocus.current = true;
    }
  }, [refresh, refetchSchoolSettings])
);
```

✅ **WhatsApp Number Priority** (Lines 178-184)
- School's configured WhatsApp number from centralized settings takes priority
- Fallback to legacy deep link helper if not configured
- Proper error handling with user-friendly alerts

✅ **School Name Display** (Lines 397-400, 447)
- School name from centralized settings appears in header
- Used in welcome greeting message
- Multiple fallback options ensure graceful degradation

✅ **Feature Toggles** (Lines 84-85)
- Financial reports feature enabled/disabled based on settings
- Petty cash feature enabled/disabled based on settings
- Defaults to enabled for backward compatibility

### 2. Settings Screen Integration

**File**: `app/screens/settings.tsx`

✅ **School Overview Section** (Lines 601-730)
- Comprehensive display for principals and admins
- Loading, error, and success states
- Shows:
  - School name
  - Regional settings (timezone, currency)
  - WhatsApp integration status with visual indicators
  - Active features summary
  - "Edit Full Settings" call-to-action

✅ **Role Gating**
- Section only visible to principals and admins
- Proper role-based access control

✅ **Real-time Data**
- Uses same `useSchoolSettings` hook
- Auto-updates when settings change
- Error handling with retry capability

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

✅ **Debug Logs Removed**
- Removed unnecessary console.log from upgrade navigation (Line 522)
- Kept console.error statements for actual error tracking
- Clean, production-ready code

✅ **Translation Keys**
- All 50+ UI translation keys verified present in `locales/en/common.json`
- Comprehensive audit documented in `docs/translation-keys-audit-step3.md`
- No missing keys - full i18n support

## User Experience

### For Principals

1. **Dashboard Header**
   - School name from database appears prominently
   - WhatsApp badge shows connection status
   - One-click access to configure settings

2. **Settings Screen**
   - Quick overview of all school configuration
   - Visual status indicators (colors, icons, badges)
   - Direct link to full settings editor

3. **WhatsApp Actions**

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Database (school_settings table)
    ↓
useSchoolSettings Hook (React Query)
    ↓
EnhancedPrincipalDashboard Component
    ↓
UI Display + Feature Gating
```

### State Management

- **React Query**: Handles caching, refetching, loading states
- **Auto-refresh**: Focus effect triggers refetch
- **Derived State**: Feature flags computed from settings
- **Fallbacks**: Multiple levels ensure graceful degradation

### Performance

- **Cached Data**: React Query caches settings to avoid unnecessary fetches
- **Optimistic UI**: Shows cached data while fetching fresh data
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with retry options
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators prevent layout shift
