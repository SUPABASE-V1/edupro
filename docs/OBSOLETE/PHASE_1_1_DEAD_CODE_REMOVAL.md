### Active Voice System Architecture (After Cleanup)
```
User ‚Üí DashVoiceFloatingButton (FAB Entry Point)
         ‚îú‚îÄ Single Tap ‚Üí Dash Assistant Chat (router.push)
         ‚îú‚îÄ Double Tap ‚Üí DashVoiceMode (OpenAI Realtime)
         ‚îî‚îÄ Long Press ‚Üí DashVoiceMode (OpenAI Realtime)

Dash Assistant Chat ‚Üí Voice Button
         ‚îú‚îÄ Supported Languages (en, af, etc.) ‚Üí DashVoiceMode
         ‚îî‚îÄ Indigenous Languages (zu, xh, nso) ‚Üí VoiceRecordingModal (Azure Speech)
```

### Remaining Voice Components
1. **DashVoiceFloatingButton** (Active FAB orb)
   - Single tap: Opens chat
   - Double tap: Toggles voice mode
   - Long press: Opens voice mode
   - Drag: Repositionable

2. **DashVoiceMode** (Elegant full-screen voice UI)
   - OpenAI Realtime API integration
   - Real-time transcription and audio streaming
   - Primary voice interface for supported languages

3. **VoiceRecordingModal** (WhatsApp-style voice recording)
   - Azure Speech transcription via Edge Function
   - Required for SA indigenous languages
   - Fallback for voice mode errors

4. **DashSpeakingOverlay** (Global speaking indicator)
   - Shows when Dash is speaking a response
   - Allows interruption

## Next Steps

‚úÖ Phase 1.1: Delete dead voice components - COMPLETE

üîÑ Phase 1.2: Simplify DashVoiceFloatingButton gestures
   - Remove double-tap logic (redundant with long press)
   - Keep: drag, single tap, long press
   - Simplify gesture state machine

‚è≥ Phase 1.3: Add dispose pattern to DashAIAssistant singleton

‚è≥ Phase 1.4: Commit Phase 1 changes

## Notes

- VoiceRecordingModal was initially marked for deletion but analysis revealed it's actively used for indigenous language support
- This is a critical feature for South African users
- Future work should consider migrating all voice to OpenAI Realtime when/if indigenous language support is added
- The simplified voice architecture now has a clear separation:
  - Modern: DashVoiceMode (OpenAI Realtime)
  - Legacy/Fallback: VoiceRecordingModal (Azure Speech)
