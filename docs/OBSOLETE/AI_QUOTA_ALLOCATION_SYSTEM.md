# AI Quota Allocation System

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive AI quota allocation system that allows schools to manage and allocate AI usage quotas to their teachers. This system supports the WARP.md Golden Rule by empowering principals to efficiently distribute AI resources among their staff.

## üåü Key Features

### 1. **School-Level Quota Management**
- Principals can view total quotas purchased by their school
- Track allocated vs. available quotas across all AI services
- Monitor real-time usage and billing cycles

### 2. **Teacher Quota Allocation**
- Allocate quotas by service type (Claude messages, content generation, assessment AI)
- Set priority levels (low, normal, high) for quota allocation
- Enable/disable auto-renewal for teacher quotas
- Suspend or reactivate teacher allocations

### 3. **Self-Service Requests**
- Teachers can request quota increases when enabled by school
- Principals can approve/reject requests with reasons
- Automatic expiry of pending requests after 7 days

### 4. **Usage Analytics & Optimization**
- Daily and monthly rollup views for performance
- AI-powered optimization suggestions for quota distribution
- Historical audit trail for all allocation changes
- Usage pattern analysis to improve resource allocation

### 5. **Multi-Tier Support**
- **Preschools (Pro+)**: Basic quota allocation features
- **K-12 Schools (Enterprise)**: Advanced allocation management
- **Individual Users**: Direct personal quotas (no allocation management)

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `school_ai_subscriptions`
- Tracks school-wide AI subscription details
- Manages total quotas, allocated quotas, and usage
- Configures allocation settings and billing cycles

#### `teacher_ai_allocations`
- Individual teacher quota allocations within schools
- Tracks used vs. allocated quotas per service
- Manages allocation metadata and priority settings

#### `ai_allocation_requests`
- Teacher self-service quota requests
- Request approval workflow with principals
- Automatic expiry and status tracking

#### `ai_allocation_history`
- Immutable audit trail for compliance
- Tracks all allocation changes with reasons
- Full before/after quota snapshots

### Enhanced AI Usage Logs
- Extended existing `ai_usage_logs` with allocation tracking
- Links usage to specific teacher allocations
- Quota consumption categorization

### Performance Optimizations
- Strategic indexes for fast queries
- Daily/monthly rollup views for analytics
- Composite indexes for organizational reporting

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Teachers**: Can only view their own allocations and usage
- **Principals/Admins**: Can manage all school allocations
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: All queries scoped by `preschool_id`

### Audit & Compliance
- All allocation changes logged with reasons
- Immutable history for regulatory compliance
- User permission checks before any allocation operations

### Data Privacy
- No PII in allocation tables beyond necessary identifiers
- Proper foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity
- Secure service role access for system operations

## üì± Frontend Components

### `AllocationManagementScreen.tsx`
- **Mobile-first design** with touch-friendly controls
- **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility** compliance
- **Real-time data** via TanStack Query
- **Graceful empty states** with no mock data
- **Error handling** with retry mechanisms

### React Hooks (`useAIAllocation.ts`)
- **Optimistic updates** with proper cache invalidation
- **Multi-tenant security** with query key scoping
- **Analytics tracking** for all allocation actions
- **Comprehensive error handling** with user feedback
