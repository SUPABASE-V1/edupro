# RLS Gap Analysis Report - EduDash Pro

**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Status:** Phase 3.3 Complete  
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (Supabase)  

## 📊 Executive Summary

EduDash Pro has **partial RLS implementation** with 14 tables having RLS enabled but **not forced**, and only 4 tables with actual policies. This represents a **significant security gap** requiring comprehensive policy implementation.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **RLS Enabled:** 14/14 analyzed tables have RLS enabled
- ❌ **RLS Forced:** 0/14 tables have RLS forced (major security risk)
- ⚠️ **Policy Coverage:** Only 4/14 tables have policies (29% coverage)
- 🚨 **Security Risk:** HIGH - Data accessible without proper policies

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### RLS Status Overview
```
✅ RLS Enabled + Not Forced: 14 tables
❌ RLS Disabled: 0 tables  
🚨 Missing Policies: 10 tables (71%)
⚠️ Basic Policies Only: 4 tables (29%)
```

### Tables with RLS Enabled (14 total)

## 📋 Policy Analysis

### Existing Policies (4 total)

#### 1. `homework_assignments_tenant_isolation` ⚠️
```sql
Policy: (preschool_id = current_preschool_id())
Command: ALL
Issues: Uses legacy function, should use app_auth.org_id()
```

#### 2. `lessons_tenant_isolation` ⚠️
```sql
Policy: (preschool_id = current_preschool_id())
Command: ALL  
Issues: Uses legacy function, should use app_auth.org_id()
```

#### 3. `ai_generations_tenant_isolation` ⚠️
```sql
Policy: (preschool_id = current_preschool_id())
Command: ALL
Issues: Uses legacy function, should use app_auth.org_id()
```

#### 4. `billing_plans_public_read` ✅
```sql
Policy: (active = true)
Command: SELECT
Status: Appropriate for global config table
```

### Policy Quality Assessment
- ⚠️ **Legacy Functions:** 3/4 policies use deprecated `current_preschool_id()`
- ❌ **No Capability Checks:** No policies enforce capability-based writes
- ❌ **No Role Differentiation:** Policies don't account for teacher vs parent access
- ❌ **Missing WITH CHECK:** No write validation policies

## 🚨 Critical Security Gaps

### 1. **CRITICAL - No RLS Enforcement** 🚨
**Impact:** All tables accessible without policy restrictions  
**Risk:** Complete data exposure across tenants  
**Tables Affected:** All 14 tables  
**Fix:** Enable `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` after implementing policies

### 2. **CRITICAL - Core Tables Without Policies** 🚨
**High-Risk Tables Missing Policies:**
- `users` - User accounts across all organizations
- `profiles` - Personal user data  
- `preschools` - Organization master data
- `classes` - Class information and assignments
- `parent_child_links` - Parent-child relationships
- `subscriptions` - Billing and subscription data

**Impact:** Cross-tenant data leakage, privacy violations  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

### 3. **HIGH - Financial Data Exposure** 🚨
**Tables:** `parent_payments`, `subscriptions`, `seats`  
**Risk:** Financial data accessible across organizations  
**Compliance:** GDPR, PCI DSS violations  
**Fix:** Immediate policy implementation required

### 4. **HIGH - Personal Data Exposure** 🚨  
**Tables:** `child_registration_requests`, `push_notifications`  
**Risk:** Child data accessible across organizations  
**Compliance:** Child protection law violations  
**Fix:** Student-scoped and parent-scoped policies required

## 🔧 Policy Requirements by Table

### Immediate Priority (CRITICAL)

#### `users` - User Account Data
```yaml
Template: user_selective
Read Policy: Own profile + org members (role-based)
Write Policy: Admin only + capability checks
Complexity: HIGH ⭐⭐⭐
```

#### `preschools` - Organization Master Data  
```yaml
Template: org_scoped_master
Read Policy: Own org + superadmin cross-tenant
Write Policy: Superadmin + principal capabilities
Complexity: MEDIUM ⭐⭐
```

#### `classes` - Class Management
```yaml
Template: org_scoped
Read Policy: app_auth.org_id() + role restrictions
Write Policy: Teacher (assigned) + principal + capabilities
Complexity: HIGH ⭐⭐⭐
```

#### `parent_child_links` - Parent-Child Relationships
```yaml
Template: junction_parent_child
Read Policy: Parent (own children) + teacher (class students) + principal (org)
Write Policy: Principal + manage_students capability
Complexity: HIGH ⭐⭐⭐
```

### High Priority

#### Financial & Subscription Tables
- `subscriptions`: Org-scoped, billing capability writes
- `parent_payments`: Parent-scoped + financial capability
- `seats`: Subscription-scoped + seat management capability

#### Child Protection Tables  
- `child_registration_requests`: Parent + principal scoped
- `push_notifications`: User-scoped + communication capability

## 🏗️ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 4.1: Critical Policy Implementation (URGENT)
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Priority:** Must complete before production deployment

1. **Legacy Function Migration** (1 hour)
   - Replace `current_preschool_id()` with `app_auth.org_id()`
   - Update 3 existing policies
   - Test function compatibility

2. **Core Table Policies** (3-4 hours)
   - Implement `users` selective exposure policy
   - Add `preschools` org-scoped policy  
   - Create `classes` teacher-assignment policy
   - Build `parent_child_links` junction policy

3. **Financial Data Protection** (1-2 hours)
   - `subscriptions` org-scoped policy
   - `parent_payments` parent + financial capability
   - `seats` subscription-scoped policy

### Phase 4.2: Comprehensive Coverage (2-3 hours)
1. **Child Protection Policies**
   - `child_registration_requests` parent + principal
   - `push_notifications` user-scoped

2. **Capability-Based Write Policies**  
   - Add `WITH CHECK` clauses for all write operations
   - Implement capability validation for sensitive operations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add RLS-optimized indexes
   - Query performance testing

### Phase 4.3: Enforcement & Validation (1-2 hours)  
1. **Enable RLS Forcing**
   - Apply `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` after validation
   - Monitor for access errors

2. **Access Pattern Testing**
   - Multi-tenant access validation
   - Role-based access verification  
   - Performance benchmarking

2. **Replace Legacy Functions** in existing policies  
3. **Test Multi-Tenant Access** patterns

### 📋 HIGH PRIORITY (Next Week)
1. **Complete Policy Coverage** for all tables
2. **Add Performance Indexes** for RLS optimization
3. **Enable RLS Forcing** after validation

### 🔍 MONITORING (Ongoing)
1. **Policy Violation Logging** and alerting
2. **Performance Impact** monitoring  
3. **Regular Security Audits** of access patterns

## 📞 Next Steps

The RLS gap analysis reveals **critical security vulnerabilities** requiring immediate attention. The next phase must focus on:

1. **Policy Manifest Creation** - Classify all tables and assign policy templates
2. **Automated Policy Generation** - Build policies from templates with capability integration  
3. **Performance Index Implementation** - Add RLS-optimized database indexes
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Validate access patterns across all roles

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Do not deploy to production until critical policies are implemented and RLS is properly enforced.
