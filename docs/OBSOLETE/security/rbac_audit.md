**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Auditor:** Security Assessment  
**Source:** `/lib/rbac.ts` analysis

## Executive Summary

EduDash Pro implements a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with hierarchical roles and capability-based permissions. The system supports multi-tenant architecture with organization-level isolation and subscription tier-based feature access.

## Role Hierarchy

```
super_admin (Level 4) ── Full system access across all organizations
    │
    ├── principal (Level 3) ── School-wide access within organization  
    │   └── principal_admin (Level 3) ── Same as principal with admin privileges
    │
    ├── teacher (Level 2) ── Class and student access within organization
    │
    └── parent (Level 1) ── Child-specific access within organization
```

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Organization Scoping
- All roles (except super_admin) are scoped to `organization_id`
- Teachers and parents have additional relationship-based scoping
- Seat management controls active/inactive status

### Relationship-Based Access
- **Teachers:** Access students through class assignments
- **Parents:** Access children through parent-child links
- **Principals:** Unrestricted within their organization

### Capability-Based Writes
- Read access primarily governed by RLS policies based on role/scope
- Write access additionally gated by specific capabilities
- Example: Managing students requires both organizational scope AND `manage_students` capability

## Security Considerations

### Current Strengths
1. **Hierarchical Design:** Clear escalation path with level-based permissions
2. **Capability Granularity:** 117 distinct capabilities for fine-grained control
3. **Multi-Tenant Safe:** Organization-level isolation built-in
4. **Subscription Integration:** Features tied to billing tiers

### Areas for RLS Alignment
1. **Super Admin Access:** Currently may bypass RLS - needs proper policy integration
2. **Principal Scope:** Requires organization-wide visibility without RLS bypass
3. **Teacher-Student Relationships:** Complex joins need optimization for RLS performance
4. **Parent-Child Links:** Multi-guardian support requires careful policy design

## Capability to Resource Mapping

### Users & Profiles
- **Read:** Role hierarchy determines scope (super_admin > principal > teacher/parent own)
- **Write:** `manage_users` capability required

### Classes & Students  
- **Read:** Organization scope + relationship-based access
- **Write:** `manage_classes`, `manage_students` capabilities

### Assignments & Grades
- **Read:** Teacher (own classes), Parent (own children), Principal (org), Super Admin (all)
- **Write:** `create_assignments`, `grade_assignments` capabilities

### AI Usage & Quotas
- **Read:** Usage visible to user + organizational admins
- **Write:** `ai_quota_management` capability for allocation changes

### Billing & Subscriptions
- **Read:** Principal (own org), Super Admin (all)
- **Write:** `manage_billing`, `manage_subscriptions` capabilities

## Conditional Logic Patterns

### Seat Status Validation
```typescript
// Teachers without active seats lose core teaching capabilities
if (role === 'teacher' && seatStatus !== 'active') {
  removeCapabilities(['manage_classes', 'create_assignments', 'grade_assignments']);
}
```

### Organization Membership
```typescript
// All non-super_admin roles require organization membership
if (role !== 'super_admin' && !organizationId) {
  return minimalCapabilities;
}
```

### Subscription Tier Gates
```typescript
// AI capabilities limited by subscription tier
if (planTier === 'free') {
  capabilities.add('ai_homework_helper'); // limited usage
} else if (planTier === 'premium') {
  capabilities.add(['ai_lesson_generation', 'ai_grading_assistance', 'ai_stem_activities']);
}
```

## Recommendations for RLS Implementation

1. **Preserve Role Hierarchy:** Ensure RLS policies respect the 4-level access model
2. **Organization First:** All policies should start with organization scoping
3. **Capability Integration:** Write policies should validate required capabilities
4. **Performance Optimization:** Index relationship tables for teacher-student joins
5. **Super Admin Support:** Use explicit policy conditions instead of RLS bypass

## Next Steps

1. Map each database table to appropriate access scope (org/class/student/user)
2. Create policy templates that incorporate both role hierarchy and capabilities
3. Design relationship helper functions for complex teacher-parent-student joins
4. Implement JWT claim structure to pass role, org_id, and capabilities to database
5. Create verification tests for each role's expected access patterns

## MISSING COMPONENTS - TODO

### SuperAdmin Role Implementation Gaps

**Current State**: SuperAdmin role exists in database and some UI components, but lacks comprehensive implementation across the application.

**Missing SuperAdmin Capabilities:**
1. **AI Model Tiering Management**
   - Override tier restrictions for any organization
   - Global AI quota allocation and monitoring
   - Model access policy configuration
   - System-wide AI usage analytics

2. **Cross-Organization Management**
   - View and manage all organizations from single dashboard
   - Global user management across all schools
   - System-wide subscription management
   - Cross-tenant data access for support

3. **System Administration**
   - Feature flag management per organization
   - Global system health monitoring
   - Database maintenance operations
   - Security incident response tools

4. **Missing SuperAdmin Screens:**
   - `/super-admin/ai-management` - Global AI usage and quota management
   - `/super-admin/organizations` - Complete organization management
   - `/super-admin/system-health` - System monitoring dashboard
   - `/super-admin/security` - Security audit and incident management

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - SuperAdmin needs are critical for scaling operations

### Principal → Teacher → Parent Flow Gaps

**Current State**: Basic role hierarchy exists, but delegation and communication flows are incomplete.

**Missing Flow Components:**

#### 1. Principal to Teacher Delegation
- **AI Quota Delegation**: Principal allocates AI requests to specific teachers
- **Class Assignment Management**: Principal assigns teachers to specific classes/grades
- **Permission Delegation**: Principal grants specific capabilities to teachers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Principal tracks teacher AI usage and effectiveness

#### 2. Teacher to Parent Communication
- **AI-Generated Reports**: Teachers share AI-generated student assessments with parents
- **Homework Assignment Flow**: Teachers assign AI-generated homework, parents receive notifications
- **Progress Sharing**: Teachers use AI insights to communicate student progress to parents
- **Parent Access Control**: Teachers control what parents can see/access

#### 3. Three-Way Communication (Principal ↔ Teacher ↔ Parent)
- **Escalation Flow**: Parent concerns → Teacher → Principal escalation path
- **AI Insights Sharing**: AI-generated insights flow between all three roles
- **Student Progress Meetings**: AI-assisted progress discussions involving all parties
- **Compliance Reporting**: AI-generated compliance reports for parents and administration

**Missing Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Teacher AI allocations (managed by principal)
CREATE TABLE teacher_ai_allocations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  principal_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  allocated_requests INTEGER,
  used_requests INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  allocation_period DATERANGE,
  restrictions JSONB -- model restrictions, feature limitations
);

-- Parent-Teacher communication permissions
CREATE TABLE parent_teacher_permissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  permissions JSONB, -- what parent can see/access
  granted_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) -- principal or teacher
);
```

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Important for user experience but not blocking

### AI Model Tiering Integration Gaps

**Current State**: Core AI tiering implemented, but missing integration with role-specific features.

**Missing Integrations:**

#### 1. Role-Specific AI Features
- **Principal AI Dashboard**: AI usage analytics, teacher performance insights
- **Teacher AI Tools**: Lesson planning, student assessment, parent communication
- **Parent AI Features**: Homework help monitoring, progress insights (read-only)

#### 2. AI Quota Management UI
- **Principal Allocation Interface**: Drag-drop quota allocation to teachers
- **Teacher Usage Monitoring**: Real-time quota usage display
- **Parent Usage Visibility**: Show child's AI homework help usage

#### 3. AI Model Access by Role
```typescript
// Role-specific model restrictions
const ROLE_MODEL_MATRIX = {
  superadmin: ['all-models'], // Full access for system management
  principal: ['all-models-in-tier'], // All models within school's tier
  teacher: ['lesson-models', 'grading-models'], // Teaching-focused models
  parent: ['homework-help-only'] // Limited to homework assistance
}
```

**Implementation Priority**: LOW - Enhancement, not blocking current functionality

### Security and Compliance Gaps

#### 1. Missing Audit Trails
- **AI Usage Logging**: Who used which model, when, for what purpose
- **Permission Changes**: Track when principals change teacher permissions
- **Data Access**: Log when users access student/parent data across roles

#### 2. Missing RLS Policies
- **Cross-Role Data Access**: Teachers accessing parent contact info
- **AI Usage Data**: Principals seeing teacher AI usage, parents seeing child's usage
- **SuperAdmin Override**: Secure but auditable cross-tenant access

#### 3. Missing Compliance Features
- **FERPA Compliance**: Educational record access controls
- **GDPR Right to be Forgotten**: Cross-role data deletion
- **Data Export**: Role-based data export capabilities

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Compliance is critical for educational institutions
