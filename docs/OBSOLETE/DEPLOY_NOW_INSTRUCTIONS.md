### **STEP 2: Deploy CAPS Memory Bank (10 minutes)**

#### A. Apply Database Migration (2 min)

**Option 1: Supabase Dashboard** (Easiest)
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to: SQL Editor
3. Click: "New Query"
4. Copy: `supabase/migrations/20251019_caps_curriculum_memory_bank.sql`
5. Paste and click: "Run"
6. Wait for: ✅ Success message

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or direct psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251019_caps_curriculum_memory_bank.sql
```

#### B. Install Dependencies (1 min)
```bash
npm install --save-dev pdf-parse
```

#### C. Set Service Key (1 min)
```bash
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > service_role
# Add to .env.local (create file if it doesn't exist)
echo "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here" >> .env.local
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE 'caps%';

-- Should show:
-- caps_documents
-- caps_content_chunks
-- caps_exam_questions

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Build Issues Fixed ✅

```bash
# Install rebuilt APK
adb install edudash-preview.apk

# Open app

# Check:
✅ Dashboard shows "Dashboard" (not "common.dashboard.title")
✅ Settings show proper text (not raw keys)
✅ All UI text is translated
```

### Test 2: Dash Voice Works ✅

```bash
# In app:
# 1. Open Dash
# 2. Tap voice/orb button
# 3. Start speaking

# Check:
✅ "Listening..." appears (not error)
✅ Transcription works
✅ Dash responds
✅ Can interrupt Dash (speak while Dash is speaking)
✅ Dash stops immediately (<250ms)
```

### Test 3: CAPS Memory Bank ✅

```bash
# In app, ask Dash:

"What does CAPS say about Grade 10 Mathematics?"
# Should return: Curriculum-specific content

"Show me past exam questions on algebra"
# Should return: Real questions from database

"What topics appear most in Grade 12 Math exams?"
# Should return: Pattern analysis (if patterns loaded)

"Get the CAPS curriculum document for Grade 11 Physics"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Migration fails with: relation already exists"

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Drop existing tables first (if re-running)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_documents CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_content_chunks CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_exam_questions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_exam_patterns CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dash_curriculum_memory CASCADE;

-- Then re-run migration
```

### "Download script: ECONNREFUSED"

**Cause:** DBE website might be down or URL changed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test one URL manually:
curl -I "https://www.education.gov.za/Portals/0/CD/..."

# If 404, update URL in download-caps-curriculum.ts
```

### "Dash doesn't use CAPS tools"

**Cause:** Tool registry not integrated with AI

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Already done in DashAIAssistant.ts! ✅
// AI automatically gets tool specs and can call them

// Verify tools are registered:
const registry = this.getToolRegistry();
console.log('Available tools:', registry.getToolNames());
// Should include: search_caps_curriculum, get_past_exam_questions, etc.
```

### "Text search returns no results"

**Check:**
```sql
-- Verify content_text is populated
SELECT 
  title, 
  LENGTH(content_text) as text_length,
  LEFT(content_text, 100) as preview
FROM caps_documents;

-- If text_length is 0, PDF extraction failed
-- Re-run download script
```

## 📈 Expected Improvement

### Before:
- ❌ Generic lessons
- ❌ No curriculum awareness
- ❌ Can't access past papers
- ❌ Guessing exam content
- ❌ Build issues (raw keys, voice broken)

### After (90 minutes from now):
- ✅ CAPS-specific lessons with references
- ✅ Full curriculum knowledge
- ✅ Past papers searchable
- ✅ Real exam questions
- ✅ Build works perfectly

**This transforms Dash from generic to expert!** 🎓

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Add Documents Gradually
Don't try to download everything at once. Start with:
- Core subjects your school teaches
- Recent years first (2023, 2022, 2021)
- Add more as needed

### Tip 2: Monitor Usage
```sql
-- Track which documents are searched
ALTER TABLE caps_documents ADD COLUMN search_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Update on each search
UPDATE caps_documents SET search_count = search_count + 1 
WHERE id = $1;

-- Find most useful documents
SELECT title, search_count FROM caps_documents 
ORDER BY search_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Tip 3: Crowdsource URLs
- DBE website structure changes
- Teachers know best resources
- Build a list collaboratively

### Tip 4: Quality Over Quantity
- 20 high-quality, well-extracted documents
- Better than 100 poorly processed ones
- Focus on what teachers actually use
