# WhatsApp-Style Voice Recording Gestures

**Implementation Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented WhatsApp-like voice recording UX directly on the mic button in the chat interface. Users can now press and hold the mic button to record, slide up to lock for hands-free mode, slide left to cancel, or release to send.

## Key Features

### 1. Press-and-Hold Recording
- **Press Down**: Recording starts immediately on `onPressIn`
- **Hold**: Recording continues while finger is down
- **Release**: Recording stops and sends on `onPressOut`

### 2. Gesture Controls
- **Slide Up (-80px)**: Locks recording for hands-free mode
- **Slide Left (-80px)**: Cancels and discards recording
- **Normal Release**: Sends the recorded voice message

### 3. Visual Feedback

#### During Gesture Recording (not locked)
- **Gesture hints** appear below input showing:
  - ↑ "Slide up to lock"
  - ← "Slide left to cancel"

#### When Locked
- **Timer pill** showing recording duration
- **Delete button** (red with trash icon)
- **Send button** (primary color with send icon)

### 4. State Management
- `voiceState`: tracks current voice controller state (prewarm, listening, transcribing, thinking, speaking, idle)
- `isVoiceLocked`: boolean indicating if recording is locked for hands-free
- `voiceTimerMs`: milliseconds elapsed during recording

## Technical Implementation

### Component: `EnhancedInputArea.tsx`

```typescript path=/home/king/Desktop/edudashpro/components/ai/EnhancedInputArea.tsx start=null
// New props added
voiceState?: VoiceState;
isVoiceLocked?: boolean;
voiceTimerMs?: number;
onVoiceCancel?: () => void;
```

#### PanResponder Integration
- Uses React Native's `PanResponder` to detect gestures
- Tracks `dx` (horizontal) and `dy` (vertical) gesture movement
- Thresholds: -80px for both lock (up) and cancel (left)

#### Mic Button Rendering
```typescript path=null start=null
<Animated.View {...panResponder.panHandlers}>
  <View style={[styles.actionButton, { backgroundColor: theme.accent }]}>
    <Ionicons name="mic" size={20} color="#fff" />
  </View>
</Animated.View>
```

#### Conditional UI States
1. **Gesture Active (not locked)**: Shows slide hints
2. **Locked**: Shows timer + delete/send buttons
3. **Idle**: Normal mic button

### Component: `DashAssistant.tsx`

#### Voice Timer Effect
```typescript path=/home/king/Desktop/edudashpro/components/ai/DashAssistant.tsx start=null
useEffect(() => {
  if (vc.state === 'prewarm' || vc.state === 'listening') {
    const start = Date.now();
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setVoiceTimerMs(Date.now() - start);
    }, 100);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  } else {
    setVoiceTimerMs(0);
  }
}, [vc.state]);
```

#### Event Handlers
- `onVoiceStart`: Calls `vc.startPress()` to begin recording
- `onVoiceEnd`: Calls `vc.release()` to send recording
- `onVoiceLock`: Calls `vc.lock()` to enable hands-free mode
- `onVoiceCancel`: Calls `vc.cancel()` to discard recording

## User Experience Flow

### Normal Send Flow
1. User presses mic button
2. Recording starts (prewarm → listening)
3. User releases mic button
4. Recording sends and transcribes
5. AI processes and responds

### Lock Flow
1. User presses mic button
2. Recording starts
3. User slides finger up 80px
4. Recording locks (hands-free)
5. Timer and action buttons appear
6. User taps "Send" button to send

### Cancel Flow
1. User presses mic button
2. Recording starts
3. User slides finger left 80px
4. Recording cancels and discards
5. Returns to idle state

## Integration with Voice Controller

The implementation relies on the existing `useVoiceController` hook which manages:
- Audio recording permissions
- Recording lifecycle (start, stop, pause)
- Transcription via Dash AI service
- State transitions

### Voice Controller Methods Used
- `startPress()`: Initiates recording
- `release()`: Stops and sends recording
- `lock()`: Enables hands-free mode
- `cancel()`: Discards current recording

### Voice Controller State
- `prewarm`: Preparing recorder
- `listening`: Actively recording audio
- `transcribing`: Converting speech to text
- `thinking`: AI processing request
- `speaking`: AI responding
- `idle`: No active recording

## Design Decisions

### Why Direct Gesture on Mic Button?
- More intuitive than opening modal first
- Matches WhatsApp UX exactly
- Immediate feedback on press
- Slide gestures feel natural

### Why -80px Threshold?
- Balances sensitivity and accidental triggers
- Sufficient distance for deliberate gesture
- Works well on various screen sizes

### Why Separate Locked Controls?
- Clear visual separation between recording and locked states
- Delete/Send buttons provide explicit actions
- Timer provides feedback on recording duration

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Press and hold to record
- [x] Slide up to lock (80px threshold)
- [x] Slide left to cancel (80px threshold)
- [x] Release to send
- [x] Timer updates during recording
- [x] Visual hints display correctly
- [x] Locked controls appear when locked
- [x] Delete button cancels recording
- [x] Send button sends recording
- [x] State transitions work correctly
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] ESLint passes with no errors in modified files

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for Later
- Visual amplitude waveform during gesture (before lock)
- Haptic feedback on slide thresholds
- Visual slide progress indicator (e.g., arrow that follows finger)
- Audio preview before sending (optional)
- Recording quality indicator
- Background blur or dim when recording

### Not Planned
- Video messages (out of scope)
- Multiple voice message queue
- Voice message editing/trimming

## Notes

- The VoiceRecordingModal is still used for locked state visualization and during transcription/thinking phases
- The mic button gesture handles only the initial recording phase
- State management is shared between input area and modal for seamless UX
- All voice recording permissions and audio handling are managed by the existing DashAIAssistant service
