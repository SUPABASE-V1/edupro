## ⚡ SUPER QUICK DEPLOY

### Copy-Paste These Commands:

```bash
# 1. Install dependency (30 seconds)
npm install --save-dev pdf-parse

# 2. Add service key (30 seconds)
# Get from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/api
# Look for: service_role (secret) key
echo "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=paste_your_key_here" >> .env.local

# 3. Download CAPS (30-60 minutes - runs automatically)
npx tsx scripts/download-caps-curriculum.ts

## ✅ VERIFICATION (5 minutes)

### Check Database:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM caps_documents;
-- Expected: 14
```

### Check Build:
```bash
# Install APK
# Open app
# Navigate to any screen
# ✅ Text should be in English, not "common.something.key"
```

### Check Dash:
```bash
# Open Dash
# Ask: "What does CAPS say about Grade 10 Math?"
# ✅ Should get curriculum-specific response
```

---

## 🎓 WHAT DASH CAN DO NOW

### Curriculum Questions:
```
"What does CAPS require for Grade 11 Physics?"
→ Returns actual CAPS curriculum content

"Show me the teaching plan for Grade 10 Math Term 2"
→ Provides CAPS teaching schedule
```

### Past Papers:
```
"Give me past exam questions on calculus"
→ Returns real questions from 2020-2024

"What appeared in 2023 Grade 12 Math papers?"
→ Shows actual questions with marks
```

### Exam Preparation:
```
"What should students focus on for Math finals?"
→ Shows high-frequency topics from pattern analysis

"Create a practice test for Grade 11 Functions"
→ Generates test from real past questions
```

### Smart Responses:
```
"Create a lesson on quadratic equations"
→ "According to CAPS Grade 10 Mathematics, Term 2, Week 4-6..."
  (With exact curriculum references!)
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "npm ERR! code ENOENT"
```bash
# Missing package.json in current directory
# Make sure you're in project root:
cd /workspace
npm install --save-dev pdf-parse
```

### "Error: Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY"
```bash
# Service key not set
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API > service_role
# Add to .env.local (NOT .env!)
```

### "Migration error: relation already exists"
```sql
-- Tables already exist, drop them first:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_documents CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_exam_questions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_exam_patterns CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dash_curriculum_memory CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS caps_content_chunks CASCADE;

-- Then re-run migration
```

### "Download script: No documents downloaded"
```bash
# Check internet connection
curl -I https://www.education.gov.za

# Check service key is correct
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY

# Run with verbose output:
DEBUG=* npx tsx scripts/download-caps-curriculum.ts
```

### "Dash doesn't use CAPS data"
```typescript
// Verify tools are registered
// In your app, open Dash and ask:
"What tools do you have access to?"

// Dash should mention:
// - search_caps_curriculum
// - get_past_exam_questions
// - get_exam_patterns
// - get_caps_document
```

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Week 1:
- [ ] 14 CAPS documents loaded
- [ ] Text search works (<200ms)
- [ ] Dash gives CAPS-specific responses
- [ ] Build issues resolved

### Month 1:
- [ ] Teachers use CAPS search 10+ times/week
- [ ] 90% satisfaction with accuracy
- [ ] Request for more subjects/grades
- [ ] Decide: keep simple or add vectors?

---

## 🎯 FRAMEWORKS (When Ready)

### Don't Add Yet (Unless You Need):
- ⏳ LangChain - Add when you need advanced RAG
- ⏳ Mem0 - Add when you need persistent memory
- ⏳ LangGraph - Add when you need multi-agent

### Why Wait?
- Current system works for 90% of use cases
- Don't add complexity until proven needed
- Simple PostgreSQL search is fast and free

### When to Add:
- ✅ LangChain: When teachers search CAPS daily + need semantic search
- ✅ Mem0: When you want Dash to remember each teacher's preferences
- ✅ LangGraph: When you need complex multi-step workflows

**Start simple, upgrade when proven!** 👍

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Start Small
Download just 5-10 documents first:
- Test the pipeline
- Verify quality
- Then download rest

### Tip 2: Monitor Usage
```sql
-- Add tracking
ALTER TABLE caps_documents ADD COLUMN times_accessed INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- See what's popular
SELECT title, times_accessed FROM caps_documents 
ORDER BY times_accessed DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Tip 3: Gradual Expansion
Week 1: 14 documents (core subjects)  
Week 2: 30 documents (more years)  
Week 3: 50 documents (all subjects)  
Month 2: 100+ documents (complete coverage)

### Tip 4: Quality Check
```sql
-- Check extraction quality
SELECT 
  title,
  page_count,
  LENGTH(content_text) as text_length,
  LENGTH(content_text) / page_count as avg_chars_per_page
FROM caps_documents;

-- avg_chars_per_page should be 2000-4000
-- If <1000, extraction might have failed
```
