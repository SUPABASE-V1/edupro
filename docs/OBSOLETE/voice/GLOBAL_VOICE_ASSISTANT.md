# Global Voice Assistant Integration ‚úÖ

## What Was Done

Added a **voice-enabled floating button** that makes Dash AI accessible from anywhere in the app with voice capabilities!

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Created**: `components/ai/DashVoiceFloatingButton.tsx`
   - Voice-enabled floating action button
   - Integrates with existing Dash AI Assistant
   - Uses the voice system we just deployed

2. **Modified**: `app/_layout.tsx`
   - Added global floating button to root layout
   - Now available on all screens

3. **Installed**: `expo-blur` package
   - For beautiful blur effects in the voice modal

## How It Works

### User Interactions

**Single Tap** üé§
- Opens quick voice interface
- Records user's voice
- Transcribes speech (TODO: implement transcription)
- Sends to Dash AI
- Speaks response back in user's preferred language
- All without leaving the current screen!

**Double Tap** üí¨
- Opens full Dash chat modal
- Complete conversation history
- Text input with all features

**Drag** üìç
- Move the button anywhere on screen
- Position is saved automatically
- Repositions itself after app restart

### Visual Feedback

- **Blue sparkle icon**: Ready state
- **Red microphone**: Recording
- **Volume icon**: Speaking response
- **Pulse animation**: Subtle attention grabber
- **Tooltip**: "Tap to speak ‚Ä¢ Double-tap for chat"

## TODO: Complete Transcription

The component currently has a placeholder for transcription. You need to implement:

```typescript
const transcribeAudio = async (uri: string): Promise<string | null> => {
  // TODO: Call your transcription service here
  // Options:
  // 1. Azure Speech-to-Text (recommended for SA languages)
  // 2. OpenAI Whisper
  // 3. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
  
  // Example with Azure:
  // const response = await fetch('YOUR_TRANSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT', {
  //   method: 'POST',
  //   body: { audio_url: uri, language: preferredLanguage }
  // });
  // return response.transcribed_text;
  
  return "Hello Dash"; // Placeholder
};
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Transcription Edge Function**
   ```bash
   supabase functions new transcribe-audio
   ```

2. **Use Azure Speech-to-Text**
   - Same credentials as TTS
   - Support for Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Sepedi
   - Real-time or batch transcription

3. **Update the component**
   - Replace placeholder with actual API call
   - Add error handling
   - Show transcription preview

---

## Testing

### How to Test

1. **Start your app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Look for the blue sparkle button** (bottom-right)

3. **Test single tap**:
   - Tap once
   - Allow microphone permission
   - Speak something
   - Tap "Stop & Send"
   - (Currently shows placeholder transcription)

4. **Test double tap**:
   - Tap twice quickly
   - Should open full Dash chat modal

5. **Test dragging**:
   - Press and drag to move button
   - Close and reopen app
   - Should remember position

### What Works Now

- ‚úÖ Button appears on all screens
- ‚úÖ Animations and interactions
- ‚úÖ Voice recording
- ‚úÖ TTS playback
- ‚úÖ Draggable positioning
- ‚úÖ Double-tap opens full chat
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transcription returns placeholder

## Configuration

### Position

Default: Bottom-right

Change in `app/_layout.tsx`:
```tsx
<DashVoiceFloatingButton 
  position="bottom-right"  // or "bottom-left", "top-right", "top-left"
  showWelcomeMessage={true}
/>
```

### Welcome Tooltip

Shows on first load. Set to `false` to disable:
```tsx
<DashVoiceFloatingButton showWelcomeMessage={false} />
```
