# Phase 5: Dependency Injection (DI) Summary

## Goal
Introduce a lightweight DI container to decouple core services (auth, storage, organization, AI, feature flags) and enable easier testing and future swapping (e.g., different auth/storage backends, test doubles).

## Scope (initial)
- Add container and tokens
- Provide default providers for Organization and Feature Flags (no runtime behavior change yet)
- Adopt incrementally in non-risky services first

## Artifacts
- lib/di/types.ts — tokens and service interfaces
- lib/di/container.ts — minimal DI container
- lib/di/providers/default.ts — default registrations (organization, features)

## Next Steps
1. Provide DI in app root (provider hook or simple container usage)
2. Gradually refactor services to accept interfaces rather than imports
3. Add unit tests using DI fakes for DashContextBuilder and analyzers

## Non-Goals (now)
- No global refactor of all services/screens
- No behavior changes
- No new runtime dependencies

## Rollout Plan
- Start with stateless consumers (builders/analyzers)
- Add unit tests using DI to inject fakes
- Expand to auth and AI after validation
