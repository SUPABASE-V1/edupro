## 📜 New Documentation Policy

The `WARP.md` file has been updated with a comprehensive **Documentation Organization** policy that mandates:

### Core Rules:
1. **ONLY** `README.md` and `WARP.md` should remain in the root directory
2. **ALL** other `.md` files must be organized in appropriate `docs/` subdirectories
3. New documentation must be immediately placed in the correct subdirectory
4. Regular audits should be performed to catch misplaced files

### Categorization Guide:
- **features/** - Feature descriptions, enhancements, and summaries
- **fixes/** - Bug fixes and issue resolutions
- **debug/** - Debugging guides and troubleshooting
- **integration/** - Third-party service integrations
- **architecture/** - System architecture and design
- **deployment/** - Deployment guides and reports
- **status/** - Project status and progress tracking
- **governance/** - Project rules and policies

---

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total .md files moved:** 29
- **Test scripts moved:** 2
- **New subdirectories created:** 3 (integration, architecture, tests)
- **Root directory cleanup:** 100% complete
- **Policy documentation updated:** ✅ WARP.md

---

## ✅ Validation

To verify the organization:

```bash
# Confirm only README.md and WARP.md in root
ls -la *.md

# View organized structure
tree docs/ -L 2

# Check test scripts
ls -la tests/
```

Expected output:
```
Root: README.md, WARP.md only
docs/: All documentation properly categorized
tests/: test-whatsapp.sh, testCrypto.ts
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Better Organization** - Documentation easy to find by category
3. **Enforced Standards** - Clear policy in WARP.md prevents future clutter
4. **Improved Navigation** - Logical structure for team members
5. **Maintainability** - Easy to audit and maintain going forward

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Team Communication** - Inform team of new documentation structure
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Consider adding a linting rule to prevent root .md files
3. **Regular Audits** - Schedule periodic checks for misplaced documentation
4. **Update Documentation** - Ensure internal links reference new file paths
