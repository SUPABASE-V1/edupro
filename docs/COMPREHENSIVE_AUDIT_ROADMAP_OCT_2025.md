---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Automated Testing**
1. **Maestro E2E** (mobile-first)
   - Flows: onboarding skip, demo mode, sign-in, language switch, AI chat, calendar open
   - Run on CI with emulator; artifacts uploaded

2. **Contract Tests** (Edge Functions)
   - ai-proxy SSE returns partials
   - Cache headers present
   - Error frames structured

3. **AI Regression Suite**
   - 20 canonical prompts across languages
   - Latency thresholds enforced

### **Manual Testing Matrix**
- Low-end Android (2GB RAM)
- Mid-tier Android
- iOS recent
- Network throttling (3G)

### **Performance Budgets**
- Fail CI if first_token_ms p50 regresses by >15%
- Crash-free sessions < 99.5%

---

## 👥 **Ownership & Timeline**

### **Team Structure**
- **Mobile (React Native)**: UI/UX, language store, streaming UI
- **AI/Edge**: ai-proxy streaming, memory, caching, quotas
- **Backend/Security**: RLS guardrails, SMS/Calendar endpoints
- **Infra/CI-CD**: EAS channels, CI gates, monitoring
- **QA**: Maestro flows, contract tests, device matrix
- **Design/UX**: Onboarding trim, microcopy, empty states, a11y

### **Execution Cadence**
- **Week 0–1**: Phase 0 (quick wins) + start Phase 4 (parallel)
- **Week 1**: Phase 1 (onboarding) + Phase 2 start (AI performance)
- **Week 2**: Finish Phase 2, Phase 3 (language), begin Phase 6 (production readiness)
- **Weeks 2–4**: Phase 5 (features) + Phase 7 (UX polish); Phase 8 ongoing

### **Checkpoints**
- Daily 15-min standup
- 48h demo cadence for Phase 0–3 items
- Friday: Metrics review (PostHog/Sentry), risk review, next-week plan

---

## 🛡️ **Risk Mitigation**

### **Production DB in Development** (Per Project Rules)
**Mitigations**:
- RLS deny DELETE broadly (except service role)
- Dev client header required on mutations
- Rate limit per session
- Audit logs with actor, app_channel, version

**Rollback**: Feature flag to hard-block risky endpoints temporarily

### **Build Instability**
- Lockfile with npm ci
- Cache node_modules in CI
- Pin Expo SDK and EAS runtime
- Smoke test before promote

### **Security/PII with AI**
- PII redaction in ai-proxy
- Service keys only server-side
- Strict persona prompts forbidding PII echo

### **Cost Overruns**
- Per-tenant quotas
- Response caching
- Token budgeter
- Low-cost model for background summarization

### **Regional STT/TTS Reliability**
- Azure region failover with backoff
- Log provider switching
- Test monthly
