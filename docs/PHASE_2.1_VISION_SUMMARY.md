- ✅ Expand icon hint

## ✅ Integration Complete!

### Final Wiring Completed

**File**: `services/DashAIAssistant.ts`

1. **✅ sendMessage()** (line 831)
   - Updated signature: `sendMessage(content: string, attachments?: DashAttachment[], conversationId?: string)`
   - Stores attachments in user message
   - Passes attachments to generateResponse()

2. **✅ generateResponse()** (line 3044)
   - Accepts attachments parameter
   - Passes attachments to generateEnhancedResponse()

3. **✅ generateEnhancedResponse()** (line 4713)
   - Accepts attachments parameter
   - Extracts base64 data from image attachments
   - Calls callAIServiceWithVision() when images present
   - Falls back to callAIService() for text-only

4. **✅ NEW: callAIServiceWithVision()** (line 5321)
   - Dedicated method for vision API calls
   - Calls 'ai-proxy' Edge Function
   - Formats images array properly
   - Handles tier-based model selection
   - Includes error handling for upgrade prompts

**File**: `components/ai/DashAssistant.tsx`

5. **✅ sendMessage()** (line 329)
   - Passes uploadedAttachments to dashInstance.sendMessage()
   - Complete integration with UI

### Implemented Data Flow

**Complete Flow:**
```
User takes photo with camera button
  → EnhancedInputArea compresses & uploads to Supabase Storage
  → Base64 conversion for AI API
  → Image preview shown with upload status
  → User clicks send
  → DashAssistant.sendMessage(text, attachments)
  → DashAIAssistant.sendMessage(text, attachments)
  → generateResponse(text, convId, attachments)
  → generateEnhancedResponse(text, convId, analysis, attachments)
  → callAIServiceWithVision({ prompt, images: base64Array })
  → ai-proxy Edge Function
  → Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Basic+ tier) or Error (Free/Starter)
  → Response with vision analysis
  → MessageBubbleModern displays image + AI response
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Once integration is complete:

### Basic Functionality

## 📊 Migration Steps

### Deploy to Production

1. **Run migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Verify bucket:**
   ```bash
   # Check that dash-attachments bucket exists
   # Check RLS policies are active
   ```

3. **Deploy Edge Function:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy ai-proxy
   ```

4. **Test on device:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:android  # Or iOS
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration** (30 minutes)
   - Update sendMessage to accept attachments
   - Update generateResponse to handle images
   - Wire callAIService to ai-proxy with image support

2. **Testing** (1 hour)
   - Test with Basic tier account
   - Verify upgrade prompts for Free/Starter
   - Test image upload and display
   - Test AI vision responses
   - Verify cost tracking

3. **Documentation** (15 minutes)
   - Update user guides
   - Add vision feature to docs
   - Document tier requirements

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Per-Image Analysis (Basic Tier)
- Small image (800×600): ~$0.001 (0.1 cent)
- Medium image (1920×1080): ~$0.008 (0.8 cents)
- Large image (2048×1536): ~$0.013 (1.3 cents)

### Monthly Usage Example (Basic Tier Teacher)
- 20 homework gradings/month: ~$0.20
- 5 classroom photos/month: ~$0.05
- 10 learning material scans/month: ~$0.10
- Regular text chat: ~$2.55
- **Total: ~$2.90/month** (within reasonable limits)

## 🚀 Performance Targets

- Image upload: < 3s on 3G
- Image compression: < 1s
- AI vision response: < 5s
- Thumbnail generation: < 500ms
- Full-size image load: < 2s
