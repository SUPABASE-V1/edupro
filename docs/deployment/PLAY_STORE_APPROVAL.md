## üîê App Signing & Security

### 1. Production Keystore Generation

**Current Issue:** Using debug keystore (`debug.keystore`) in production build configuration.

#### Generate Production Keystore

```bash
# Generate a new production keystore
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore edudashpro-production.keystore \
  -alias edudashpro \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -storepass [SECURE_PASSWORD] \
  -keypass [SECURE_PASSWORD] \
  -dname "CN=EduDash Pro, OU=Mobile, O=EduDash Pro, L=City, ST=State, C=ZA"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** 
- Store keystore file securely (DO NOT commit to git)
- Document credentials in secure password manager
- Create backups in multiple secure locations
- NEVER lose this keystore - you cannot update your app without it!

#### Configure EAS Build for App Signing

**Option A: Let EAS Manage Signing (Recommended)**

```json
// eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "channel": "production",
      "credentialsSource": "remote",  // Already set ‚úÖ
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
eas credentials:configure --platform android
```

**Option B: Use Your Own Keystore**

1. Upload keystore to EAS:
```bash
eas credentials:configure --platform android
# Choose "Set up a new Android Keystore"
# Provide keystore path and credentials
```

2. Or configure manually in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('EDUDASH_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(EDUDASH_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword EDUDASH_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias EDUDASH_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword EDUDASH_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release  // Update this!
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Google Play App Signing

- [ ] **Enable Google Play App Signing**
  - Upload your app signing key to Google Play Console
  - Google will manage the actual signing key
  - You only need the upload certificate

### 3. Security Audit

- [ ] **Remove Debug Code**
  - ‚úÖ `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CONSOLE: "false"` in production ‚úÖ
  - ‚úÖ `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEST_TOOLS: "0"` ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Verify no hardcoded credentials in code
  - [ ] Check for debug logs in production

- [ ] **ProGuard/R8 Configuration**
  - ‚úÖ Basic rules exist in `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`
  - [ ] Add comprehensive ProGuard rules (see below)

#### Enhanced ProGuard Rules

Add to `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:

```proguard

}

# Remove logging (if not already removed by babel)

### 6. AdMob Production Setup

**Current (app.json):**
```json
"androidAppId": "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713",  // ‚ùå TEST ID
```

**Action:**
1. Create AdMob account: https://admob.google.com
2. Create new Android app
3. Get production app ID: `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~XXXXXXXXXX`
4. Update in `app.json`:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-google-mobile-ads",
      {
        "androidAppId": "ca-app-pub-REAL_ID_HERE~XXXXXXXXXX",

          "com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID": "ca-app-pub-REAL_ID_HERE~XXXXXXXXXX"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```
5. Update `eas.json` environments if needed

- [ ] Split APKs by ABI (AAB does this automatically ‚úÖ)

Current `build.gradle`:
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds  // Set to true
        shrinkResources true  // Enable this
    }
}
```

Add to `gradle.properties`:
```properties
android.enableProguardInReleaseBuilds=true
android.enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds=true
android.enablePngCrunchInReleaseBuilds=true
```
