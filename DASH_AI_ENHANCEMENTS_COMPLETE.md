## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompt** ✅
Added rich contextual information to every AI request:
- 📅 Current date/time (South African Time)
- 👤 User info (role, organization, name)
- 🔧 Available tools with usage guidance
- 🎓 CAPS curriculum phases
- 📝 Complete exam question rules
- 🌍 Multilingual support
- 🇿🇦 SA education context

### 2. **Tool Registry Verified** ✅
Confirmed both tools are properly configured:
- ✅ `query_database` - For retrieving user data
- ✅ `generate_caps_exam` - For creating CAPS exams

Tools are passed correctly to Claude API.

### 3. **Context Information Wired** ✅
User context now automatically included in every request:
- Role (teacher, parent, principal)
- Organization name
- User name

## 📊 Impact

### Before:
```
User: "Generate a math test"
Dash: "Calculate the common difference"  ← Incomplete!
```

### After:
```
User: "Generate a math test"
Dash: [Using generate_caps_exam tool]
"Calculate the common difference in this sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
← Complete with data!
```

### Context Awareness:
```
User: "Who am I?"
Dash: "You're John Smith, a teacher at Happy Kids Preschool."
← Knows user context!
```

### Tool Usage:
```
User: "How many students do I have?"
Dash: [Uses query_database tool]
"You have 24 students across 3 classes."
← Real data from database!
```

---

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Edge Function
```bash
cd supabase
supabase functions deploy ai-proxy
```

### Step 2: Fix AI Logging (if not done)
Via Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.ai_usage_logs 
ALTER COLUMN ai_service_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Open Dash AI in app
2. Try: "Who am I?" → Should show your name/role
3. Try: "Generate a Grade 9 math test" → Should create complete exam
4. Try: "How many students do I have?" → Should query database

📋 USER CONTEXT:
- Role: teacher
- Organization: Happy Kids Preschool
- User: John Smith

🔧 AVAILABLE TOOLS (2):
- **query_database**: Execute safe, read-only database queries...
- **generate_caps_exam**: Generate CAPS-aligned examination papers...

WHEN TO USE TOOLS:
✅ User asks about their data → use query_database
✅ User wants exam/test/assessment → use generate_caps_exam
✅ Always use tools for accurate, real-time data
❌ DO NOT make up data when tool can provide it

🎓 CAPS CURRICULUM EXPERTISE:
Foundation (R-3) | Intermediate (4-6) | Senior (7-9) | FET (10-12)

📝 EXAM GENERATION (use generate_caps_exam tool):
✅ COMPLETE QUESTIONS (include ALL data):
- "Calculate common difference: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14"
- "Simplify: (x + 3)(x - 2)"
❌ INCOMPLETE (missing data):
- "Calculate the difference" ← which sequence?
- "Study the diagram" ← NO diagrams!

🇿🇦 SA CONTEXT: School year Jan-Dec, 4 terms, Rand (R), load-shedding aware
```

## 🔧 Tool Registry Status

### Query Database Tool:
```typescript
{
  name: 'query_database',
  description: 'Execute safe, read-only database queries...',
  available_to: ['parent', 'teacher', 'principal', 'superadmin']
}
```

### Generate CAPS Exam Tool:
```typescript
{
  name: 'generate_caps_exam',
  description: 'Generate structured, CAPS-aligned examination paper...',
  available_to: ['parent', 'teacher', 'principal']
}
```

**Tool Loading**:
```typescript
if (enable_tools) {
  availableTools = getToolsForRole(role, tier)
  console.log(`Loaded ${availableTools.length} tools for role=${role}`)
}
```

✅ **Working correctly!**
