# ✅ Session Complete: School Fee Management System

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Duration**: ~2 hours

---

## 📝 What You Asked For

> "Can we implement a way for principals or admins to setup fees for their schools especially for preschools as they have a vast difference in fee structures - and remove the mock fees data from the parent dashboard - and the parent dashboard should fetch fees based on the age groups setup by their school - and link the payment system end to end - then update our audit system and move on"

---

## ✅ What Was Delivered
