## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Free limit reached" on first try
- **Cause**: LocalStorage key already set from previous session
- **Fix**: Clear browser localStorage or wait until next day

**Issue**: AI generation not working
- **Cause**: `ai-proxy` Edge Function not enabled or not deployed
- **Fix**: 
  ```bash
  npx supabase functions deploy ai-proxy
  # Verify environment variable
  echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROXY_ENABLED
  ```

**Issue**: Subjects not showing for selected grade
- **Cause**: Grade not mapped to correct phase
- **Fix**: Check `getPhase()` function in `ExamPrepWidget.tsx`

**Issue**: Database migration fails
- **Cause**: Conflicting table names or RLS policies
- **Fix**: 
  ```bash
  # Check existing tables
  npx supabase db remote ls
  # Drop conflicting tables if needed (CAUTION!)
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.past_papers CASCADE;
  ```
