# Dash Exam Improvements - Interactive Practice Mode

## Overview
Enhanced Dash's exam preparation feature to make it more interactive and customizable, addressing the key issues:
1. ‚úÖ Practice exams now show immediate answers and explanations
2. ‚úÖ Customizable exam duration selector
3. ‚úÖ Clear distinction between practice and regular exams

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Exam Parser (`web/src/lib/examParser.ts`)

#### Added Practice Mode Support
- **New field**: `explanation` in `ExamQuestion` interface - stores detailed explanations for answers
- **New fields**: `isPractice` and `duration` in `ParsedExam` interface - distinguishes practice from regular exams
- **Enhanced `gradeAnswer()` function**:
  - Now accepts `isPracticeMode` parameter (defaults to `true`)
  - For **practice mode**: Shows model answers and explanations immediately
  - For **regular exams**: Shows "Teacher will review" message
  - Multiple choice: Shows correct answer with explanation
  - Open-ended questions: Displays model answer for comparison

#### Feedback Examples
- ‚úÖ **Correct MC**: "‚úÖ Correct! [explanation]"
- ‚ùå **Incorrect MC**: "‚ùå Incorrect. The correct answer is: B\n\n[explanation]"
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Open-ended**: "‚úèÔ∏è Your answer recorded. Compare with model answer:\n\n[model answer]\n\nüí° [explanation]"
- üìù **Regular exam**: "üìù Answer recorded. Teacher will review your response."

### 2. Interactive Exam View (`web/src/components/dashboard/exam-prep/ExamInteractiveView.tsx`)

#### Practice Mode Integration
- Passes `exam.isPractice` flag to `gradeAnswer()` function
- Enables `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` for proper formatting of multi-line explanations
- Students see immediate feedback with model answers after submission

### 3. Exam Prep Widget (`web/src/components/dashboard/exam-prep/ExamPrepWidget.tsx`)

#### New Duration Selector
Added a customizable duration dropdown that appears when "Practice Test" is selected:

**Duration Options:**
- Quick Test - 15 minutes
- Short - 30 minutes
- Medium - 45 minutes
- Standard - 60 minutes
- Extended - 90 minutes
- Full Exam - 2 hours
- Comprehensive - 3 hours
- Default (uses grade-appropriate duration)

#### Updated Exam Generation Prompts
- Informs AI that this is a **PRACTICE EXAM** requiring model answers and explanations
- Uses `actualDuration` variable that respects custom duration or falls back to default
- Updated prompts to emphasize including model answers and explanations in the memorandum
- Modified instructions to clearly state "PRACTICE EXAM - Students need immediate feedback"

#### UI Enhancements
- Duration selector with ‚è±Ô∏è icon and helpful tooltip
- Only shows for practice tests (not for revision notes, study guides, or flashcards)
- Shows default duration for each grade level as an option
- Clear indication when custom duration is selected

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
‚ùå All answers showed "Teacher will review your response"

‚úÖ Practice exams show immediate answers and detailed explanations
‚úÖ Students can learn from their mistakes right away
