## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
# Option A: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Copy contents of 20251031000000_implement_user_trial_subscriptions.sql
# 3. Run the migration
# 4. Verify no errors

# Option C: Direct psql
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/20251031000000_implement_user_trial_subscriptions.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Changes
```sql
-- 1. Check if functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname IN ('start_parent_trial', 'get_my_trial_status');
-- Expected: 2 rows

-- 2. Check subscriptions table structure
\d subscriptions
-- Should see: owner_type, user_id, school_id columns

-- 3. Check constraint exists
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conname = 'subscriptions_owner_check';
-- Expected: 1 row

-- 4. Test start_parent_trial function (as authenticated user)
SELECT start_parent_trial();
-- Should return JSON with success=true or already_exists=true

-- 5. Test get_my_trial_status function (as authenticated user)
SELECT get_my_trial_status();
-- Should return JSON with status, plan_tier, etc.
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Build frontend
cd web
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
vercel deploy --prod
# OR
netlify deploy --prod
# OR your preferred deployment method
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

#### A. Test Parent Signup (No School)
```
1. Go to /sign-up/parent
2. Fill in required fields
3. SKIP organization selection
4. Submit form
5. ‚úÖ No validation errors
6. ‚úÖ Account created successfully
7. Verify email (if enabled)
8. Login
9. ‚úÖ Redirected to dashboard
10. ‚úÖ See "Independent Parent" badge
11. ‚úÖ See "Welcome to Your 7-Day Free Trial!" message
12. Open browser console
13. ‚úÖ See "üéâ Parent trial started successfully"
14. Check TierBadge
15. ‚úÖ Shows "Starter" (not "Free")
```

#### B. Test Parent Signup (With School)
```
1. Go to /sign-up/parent
2. Fill in required fields
3. SELECT an organization (that has free tier)
4. Submit form
5. ‚úÖ Account created successfully
6. Login and go to dashboard
7. ‚úÖ See school name badge
8. Open browser console
9. ‚úÖ See "üéâ Parent trial started successfully"
10. Check TierBadge
11. ‚úÖ Shows "Starter" (not school's "Free")
```

#### C. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check that new parent got trial subscription
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.owner_type,
  s.status,
  s.trial_end_date,
  sp.tier as plan_tier,
  p.email,
  p.first_name
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON s.plan_id = sp.id
JOIN profiles p ON s.user_id = p.id
WHERE s.owner_type = 'user'
AND s.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

-- Expected: See new parent's trial subscription
-- owner_type = 'user'
-- status = 'trialing'
-- trial_end_date ~7 days from now
```

#### D. Test Multiple Dashboard Visits
```
1. Login as parent with trial
2. Go to dashboard
3. Open console
4. ‚úÖ See "‚úì Parent trial already active" (not "started successfully")
5. Check database
6. ‚úÖ Still only ONE subscription for this user (no duplicates)
```

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Watch
```
1. Parent Signups
   - Track signups with vs without school
   - Measure completion rate
   
2. Trial Activation Rate
   - % of parents who get trials activated
   - Should be ~100% for new signups
   
3. Error Rates
   - Watch for errors in start_parent_trial()
   - Watch for errors in get_my_trial_status()
   
4. Trial Usage
   - Track AI requests during trial period
   - Measure feature adoption
```

### Database Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Count active user trials
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_trials
FROM subscriptions
WHERE owner_type = 'user'
AND status = 'trialing'
AND trial_end_date > NOW();

-- List parents who didn't get trials
SELECT p.id, p.email, p.created_at
FROM profiles p
WHERE p.role = 'parent'
AND p.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM subscriptions s
  WHERE s.owner_type = 'user'
  AND s.user_id = p.id
);

-- Count independent parents (no school)
SELECT COUNT(*) as independent_parents
FROM profiles
WHERE role = 'parent'
AND preschool_id IS NULL
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

### Immediate Rollback (Frontend Only)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback
# OR
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

### Partial Rollback (Keep Database, Revert UI)
```bash
# Revert frontend changes only
git revert <commit-hash-for-signup-page>
git revert <commit-hash-for-dashboard>
git push

# Database functions remain (they're additive, no breaking changes)
```

### Full Rollback (Nuclear Option)
```sql
-- Only if absolutely necessary
-- 1. Drop new RPC functions (optional - they don't hurt)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS start_parent_trial();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_my_trial_status();

-- Note: DO NOT delete user subscriptions that were created
-- They represent real trials parents signed up for
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Trial Not Starting
**Symptoms**: Console shows error when calling `start_parent_trial()`

**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check if function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'start_parent_trial';

-- Check if user is authenticated
SELECT auth.uid();  -- Should return UUID, not NULL

-- Check user's role
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Check subscription_plans table has starter plan
SELECT id, tier FROM subscription_plans WHERE tier = 'starter';
```

**Fix**:
- If function missing: Re-run migration
- If not authenticated: Check auth session
- If role wrong: Update profile role to 'parent'
- If no starter plan: Create one in subscription_plans table

### Issue: Still Showing "Free" Tier
**Symptoms**: TierBadge shows "Free" even with active trial

**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check user's subscription
SELECT * FROM get_my_trial_status();

-- Check subscriptions table directly
SELECT * FROM subscriptions 
WHERE owner_type = 'user' 
AND user_id = auth.uid();
```

**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for RPC errors
- Verify subscription status = 'trialing'
- Check trial_end_date is in future

### Issue: "Organization Required" Error
**Symptoms**: Can't submit signup form without selecting organization

**Debug**:
- Check if frontend changes deployed
- Check browser cache
- View page source to verify latest code

**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Re-deploy frontend

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- [x] New parents can sign up without selecting organization
- [x] Trial auto-activates on first dashboard visit
- [x] TierBadge shows "Starter" for parents with trials
- [x] Parents in free-tier schools get their own trials
- [x] No duplicate subscriptions created
- [x] No errors in browser console
- [x] No errors in database logs
