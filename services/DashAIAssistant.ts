/**
 * @deprecated This file is deprecated and scheduled for removal.
 * 
 * The monolithic DashAIAssistant has been modularized into services/dash-ai/* per WARP.md standards:
 * - services/dash-ai/DashAICore.ts - Main orchestration
 * - services/dash-ai/DashVoiceService.ts - Voice/STT/TTS
 * - services/dash-ai/DashMemoryService.ts - Context & memory
 * - services/dash-ai/DashTaskManager.ts - Task management
 * - services/dash-ai/DashConversationManager.ts - Conversation handling
 * - services/dash-ai/DashAINavigator.ts - Navigation integration
 * - services/dash-ai/types.ts - Shared types
 * 
 * Migration path:
 * 1. Update imports to use services/dash-ai/DashAICompat (compatibility layer)
 * 2. Gradually migrate to direct modular services
 * 3. Remove this stub file once all references are updated
 * 
 * See: WARP.md File Size Standards, ROAD-MAP.md Phase 3 (Week 2)
 * Status: Empty stub - to be removed after full migration verification
