**What Happens**:
1. System calls `create_invoice_from_fee_assignment()`
2. Fetches student details (name, number, grade)
3. Fetches school details (name, address)
4. Generates unique invoice number
5. Creates invoice record
6. Creates line item for the fee
7. Sets status to "sent"
8. Triggers email notification (when implemented)

**Result**: Professional invoice ready to send!
