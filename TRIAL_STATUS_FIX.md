# ✅ Trial Status Display - Parent Dashboard Fix

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Problem

The parent dashboard was **NOT showing the free trial status** or days remaining.

### Why It Wasn't Working:
- ❌ `useTrialStatus` hook exists but was **never imported or used** in ParentDashboard
- ❌ No UI component to display trial information
- ❌ The RPC function `get_my_trial_status()` exists in the database but wasn't being called

---

## ✅ Solution

Added complete trial status tracking and display to the Parent Dashboard.

### What Was Added:

1. **Trial Status State**
   ```typescript
   const [trialStatus, setTrialStatus] = useState<{
     is_trial: boolean;
     days_remaining: number;
     plan_tier: string;
     plan_name: string;
   } | null>(null);
   ```

2. **Trial Status Fetching (useEffect)**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     const loadTrialStatus = async () => {
       if (!userId) return;
       
       const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_my_trial_status');
       
       if (data) {
         setTrialStatus(data);
       }
     };
     
     loadTrialStatus();
   }, [userId]);
   ```

3. **Beautiful Trial Banner UI**
   - Shows trial days remaining
   - Dynamic colors based on urgency:
     - 🟢 **Green:** 8-14 days (plenty of time)
     - 🟠 **Orange:** 4-7 days (heads up!)
     - 🔴 **Red:** 1-3 days (urgent!)
   - "Upgrade Now" button when trial is expiring (≤7 days)
   - Positioned prominently at the top of the dashboard

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
```
web/src/app/dashboard/parent/page.tsx
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Trial Status State** (Line 48-53)
   - Stores trial information fetched from database
   - Includes: `is_trial`, `days_remaining`, `plan_tier`, `plan_name`

2. **Added Trial Fetch useEffect** (Line 162-184)
   - Calls `get_my_trial_status()` RPC function
   - Runs when `userId` is available
   - Error handling with console logging

3. **Added Trial Banner UI** (Line 418-470)
   - Conditional rendering (only shows if `is_trial === true`)
   - Dynamic styling based on `days_remaining`
   - Responsive design with flexbox
   - "Upgrade Now" button (shows when ≤7 days)
   - Links to pricing page

---

## 🎯 Color Logic

```typescript
Background Color:
- days_remaining <= 3  → Red (#ef4444 to #dc2626)
- days_remaining <= 7  → Orange (#f59e0b to #d97706)
- days_remaining > 7   → Green (#10b981 to #059669)

Button Visibility:
- Show "Upgrade Now" button when days_remaining <= 7

Button Color:
- days_remaining <= 3  → Red text (#dc2626)
- days_remaining > 3   → Orange text (#d97706)
```

## 📊 Database Integration

### RPC Function Used:
```sql
get_my_trial_status()
```

### Returns:
```json
{
  "is_trial": true,
  "days_remaining": 10,
  "plan_tier": "premium",
  "plan_name": "Premium"
}
```

### Function Location:
```
supabase/migrations/20251026223350_implement_14_day_free_trial.sql

## 🚀 How to Test

### **1. Check if a user is in trial:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM get_my_trial_status();
```

### **2. Manually set trial for testing:**
```sql
-- Set user's organization to trial (14 days)
UPDATE subscriptions
SET 
  is_trial = true,
  trial_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days',
  plan_tier = 'premium'
WHERE preschool_id = (
  SELECT preschool_id FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
);
```

### **3. Test different urgency levels:**
```sql
-- Test with 2 days remaining (RED banner)
UPDATE subscriptions
SET trial_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '2 days'
WHERE preschool_id = (
  SELECT preschool_id FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
);

-- Test with 5 days remaining (ORANGE banner)
UPDATE subscriptions
SET trial_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '5 days'
WHERE preschool_id = (
  SELECT preschool_id FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
);

-- Test with 10 days remaining (GREEN banner)
UPDATE subscriptions
SET trial_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '10 days'
WHERE preschool_id = (
  SELECT preschool_id FROM profiles WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
);
```

### **4. View in Browser:**
1. Login as parent
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/parent`
3. Should see trial banner at the top (below greeting, above children cards)

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **The hook existed but wasn't used**
   - Always check if functionality already exists before creating new code
   - The `get_my_trial_status()` RPC was ready to use

2. **Web vs Mobile**
   - Mobile has React Query setup (`useTrialStatus` hook)
   - Web uses simple `useEffect` + `useState` pattern
   - Both approaches are valid for different contexts

3. **User Psychology**
   - Color coding creates urgency without being annoying
   - Showing exact days builds trust
   - Clear CTA increases conversion

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND TESTED  
**Impact:** HIGH - Critical for user awareness and conversions  
**Risk:** LOW - Isolated change, no breaking changes

---

*Trial status is now fully visible and functional in the parent dashboard!* 🎉
