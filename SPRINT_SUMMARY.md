## 🎉 What We Built

### **Flexible Parent Sign-Up Flow (MVP)**

---

## ✨ Key Improvements

### **Before:**
```
❌ All parents MUST link to a school
❌ Homeschoolers blocked
❌ Independent learners excluded
❌ High abandonment rate
```

### **After:**
```
✅ 6 usage types supported
✅ School linking OPTIONAL
✅ All parents welcome
✅ Context-aware experience
```

---

## 🎯 Features Delivered
