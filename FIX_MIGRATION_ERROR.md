# 🔧 Fix Migration Error - QUICK SOLUTION

## ❌ Your Error:
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "public.exam_generations" does not exist
```

## ✅ The Fix:

You tried to run the **exam assignments** migration before creating the **exam_generations** table!

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Run This One File

### **Copy & Paste Into Supabase SQL Editor:**

**File**: `/workspace/migrations/ALL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql`

This single file contains EVERYTHING in the correct order:
1. ✅ Creates `exam_generations` table first
2. ✅ Then creates `exam_assignments` table (which depends on #1)
3. ✅ Plus all helper functions
4. ✅ Plus all RLS policies

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step:

### **1. Open Supabase Dashboard**
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
```

### **2. Copy the File**
```bash
# On your local machine, open:
/workspace/migrations/ALL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql

# Or cat it:
cat /workspace/migrations/ALL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql
```

### **3. Paste & Run**
- Paste entire contents into SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"**
- Wait for success message

### **4. Verify Success**
You should see:
```
✅ ALL MIGRATIONS COMPLETE!
   - exam_generations table created
   - exam_assignments table created
   - exam_submissions table created
   ...
```

---

## 🎯 What This Does:

```
Step 1: Create exam_generations       ← THIS WAS MISSING!
        └─> exam_assignments         ← Depends on step 1
        └─> exam_submissions         ← Depends on step 1

Step 2: Create helper functions
        ├─> get_assignment_stats()
        ├─> get_my_exam_assignments()
        └─> can_submit_exam()

Step 3: Setup RLS policies (security)
```

---

## ✅ After Running:

### **Restart Dev Server**
```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

### **Test Teacher Flow**
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/teacher/exams
```

### **Test Student Flow**
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/student/exams
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Tables Exist:

Run this query after migration:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'exam_generations',
  'exam_assignments',
  'exam_submissions',
  'past_papers',
  'exam_user_progress'
)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should return **5 rows** ✅

---

## 💡 Why This Happened:

The migration files were in different folders:
- ❌ `20251030141353_add_exam_prep_tables.sql` was in `supabase/migrations/` (not run)
- ❌ `04_exam_assignments_system.sql` was in `migrations/pending/` (tried to run first)

The combined file fixes the order!

---

## 🎉 That's It!

Just run the one combined SQL file and you're done! 🚀
