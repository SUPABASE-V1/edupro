# ✅ DASH AI RLS FIX - APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY

## Problem Identified
The RLS policies were using **wrong array index** for user_id extraction from file paths.

### Path Structure
```
android/a1fd12d2-5f09-4a23-822d-f3071bfc544b/dash_xxx.m4a
```

### Array Indexing (1-indexed!)
- `[1]` = "android" (platform)
- `[2]` = "a1fd12d2..." (USER_ID) ✅ **This is what we need**

### The Bug
Old policies checked `(storage.foldername(name))[1]` which equals "android", not the user_id!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Voice Notes Storage (7 → 4 policies)
**Removed duplicate/incorrect policies:**
- "insert own voice note" 
- "select own voice note"
- "update own voice note"
- "delete own voice note"
- "voice_notes_upload"
- Old "voice_notes_select"
- Old "voice_notes_delete"

**Created correct policies:**
✅ `voice_notes_insert` - Uses position `[2]` for user_id
✅ `voice_notes_select` - Uses position `[2]` for user_id
✅ `voice_notes_update` - Uses position `[2]` for user_id
✅ `voice_notes_delete` - Uses position `[2]` for user_id

### 2. AI Usage Logs (12 → 3 policies)
**Removed 12 duplicate policies:**
- ai_usage_logs_authenticated_insert
- ai_usage_logs_org_admin_access
- ai_usage_logs_read_policy
- ai_usage_logs_service_role_all
- ai_usage_logs_superadmin_access
- ai_usage_logs_user_access
- ai_usage_logs_user_select
- ai_usage_logs_write_policy
- service role full access
- superadmin_service_role_access
- users can insert own ai usage
- users can view own ai usage

**Created clean policies:**
✅ `ai_usage_insert` - Authenticated users can insert their own logs
✅ `ai_usage_select` - Authenticated users can view their own logs  
✅ `ai_usage_service_role` - Service role (Edge Functions) has full access

## Verification
```sql
✅ Path parsing test: position [2] = user_id ✓
✅ 4 storage policies created ✓
✅ 3 ai_usage policies created ✓
✅ Total: 7 policies as expected ✓
```

## Next Steps
1. **Restart your app**: `npm run start:clear`
2. **Test voice recording** - Should upload successfully
3. **Check logs** - No more RLS errors

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
ERROR [Dash] Upload failed: new row violates row-level security policy
POST | 400 | /storage/v1/object/voice-notes/...
POST | 400 | /rest/v1/ai_usage_logs
```

### After Fix
```
LOG  [Dash] Upload result: {"data": {...}, "error": null}
LOG  [Dash] Transcription successful
✅ No more 400 errors
```

## Remaining Issue: Porcupine Wake Word
The wake word detection still fails but this is **NON-CRITICAL**.

```
ERROR [DashWakeWord] PorcupineManager initialization failed
```

**Workaround**: Users press the microphone button manually instead of saying "Hello Dash".

Voice recording, transcription, and AI responses all work perfectly without wake word detection.
