## 🚀 Next Enhancement: Student Assignment Flow

**What to build next**:

```typescript
// 1. Assignment Modal
<AssignExamModal
  examId={exam.id}
  onAssign={async (studentIds, dueDate) => {
    await supabase.from('exam_assignments').insert({
      exam_generation_id: examId,
      student_ids: studentIds,
      assigned_by: teacher.id,
      due_date: dueDate,
      status: 'assigned'
    });
  }}
/>

// 2. Results View
<ExamResults
  examId={exam.id}
  showScores={true}
  showAnswers={true}
/>
```

---

## 📊 Integration Points

### Main Teacher Dashboard
**Add exam metrics**:
```typescript
// In teacher/page.tsx
<MetricCard
  title="Active Exams"
  value={activeExams.length}
  icon={FileText}
  onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard/teacher/exams')}
/>
```

### Navigation Menu
